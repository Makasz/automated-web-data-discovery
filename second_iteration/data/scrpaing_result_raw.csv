restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|. Brief recap! Parma Ham is one of those products where you are gifted instant flavour, the work all being done by the producer before it hits your plate. It is preservative free, being just Pork + Air + Salt + Time and lessons learned from history and generations of prior producers. Parma Ham plays well with others and gifts instant depth of flavour to many things. It makes a lovely crisp jacket when you wrap other things in it, whether that is a bundle of green beans or asparagus, a lovely piece of fish or in this case pork belly.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|My pork belly obsession is well documented. It is a perfect roast, yes, especially when you roast it slow. It is brilliantly flexible beyond this though. I have taken to cooking smaller amounts of pork belly quicker with excellent results. This Parma Ham wrapped pork belly is a perfect example and it is so good. The ham keeps all the pork belly juices inside as it cooks, and gives it an extra deeply savoury layer.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|On the side, as much as I love the humble spud and a slick plate of mash, I go for beans here. Beans also make great mash and they are especially nice for summer or Autumn. I like to use a plump butter bean (or better yet, Greek gigantes beans). Not only do they make a delicious mash, they make an instant one too. Protein rich with a hint of garlic and savouriness of rosemary. Those roasting juices from the pork belly wrapped with Parma Ham are sublime and elevate everything.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|You can of course use a favourite chilli oil or one that you have at home. I provide a recipe for a simple one here flavoured with garlic and chilli. Play around, make a peppercorn oil, add herbs as it cools down (not at the beginning or they will burn). Homemade oils bring brilliant flavour. If you don’t want chilli make a simple herb oil by blending a flavourful herb (like oregano or basil) with some oil, allowing it to infuse and then pass it through a coffee filter or similar and you are good to go.

Especially at my Grandmothers when we would visit on St Stephen’s Day (aka Boxing Day). I knew that I would have to eat that ham in order to access some biscuits. As with most things, it was beautiful in its simplicity. Thick sliced bread, butter, home cooked ham, done.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|My rural Irish childhood involved only Irish ham (which is of course very good). It was often home-cooked, thickly sliced, and sometimes pulled directly from the ham by my tiny enthusiastic hands. When I moved from rural Ireland to Cork city, I discovered a wonderful Italian deli (Iago’s), where I would become a regular. It was there that I discovered the joys of Parma Ham. I went through a phase of wrapping everything in it, and I still do sometimes today. I especially love it as a satisfying meaty snack for moments requiring instant gratification.

It is horribly underrated and completely delicious. Once you get the real thing. Tofu is thought of as a vegetarian or vegan ingredient, and yes it is, but in Asia it is as common to see it in a dish with meat, as not. See my recipe for
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|Tofu is also a fast food. The fastest, it is already good to go. It soaks up flavours and loves contrasting textures. I love it in a crispy fritter for brunch as much as I do in a stew. I love proper silken tofu, fresh from fridges of Asian food shops (especially Japanese). Silken is a joy, the very good stuff has the texture of custard. All of it is sublime when fried, and I have fried tofu every which way. A firm – nay, wobbly – favourite is Agedashi Tofu.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|A Japanese delight of a dish, age-dashi means fry-dashi and that is what this is, fried tofu with a seasoned dashi broth. Seasoned with soy and mirin (you can use sake too). It is naturally gluten free, usually using potato starch or corn starch. I love to use potato starch for this, it confers a stretchy crispness which is perfect with the wobbly tofu underneath. I sometimes mix the potato starch with rice flour, and of course you can just use rice flour too which will give a lovely crisp coating.

Windows draped by small curtains looked at the mountains outside. We took a table in the corner and perused the traditional menu. I love the menus in places like this. Plump käsespätzle (handmade noodle shreds in a voluptuous and generous cheese sauce) and schnitzel were what drew most of us in.

It is a relief to see the buds open at Springtime and the trees begin to flourish, as they are this week. Walks home from the supermarket are peppered with mini assaults of blossom fragrance. The footpaths are dusted with their petals. The days are longer, the sky brighter, there is the promise of summer to come.

It is one of four of Canada’s Atlantic provinces on the east coast. 83% of New Brunswick is under forest, and the cities are small by international standards. It is a perfect relaxed spot for a break and to unwind. I flew into Saint John via Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Populations arrived from Europe from the 1600s included French, British and Irish. The city of Miramichi claims to be the Irish capital of Canada and was one of the points of arrival for many of Ireland’s coffin ships during the famine.

One other fundamental new string that Tom has incorporated in his repertoire is premium smoke in the form of a new konro grill that takes binchotan. He showed us a few dishes, of the ones that stood out for me, were the oyster with smoked Chantilly cream as well as the lobster – cooked in shell to a perfect mi-cuit centre, and imbued with a very subtle lacing of smoke. Lovely cuisson, but it gets better as he matches the lobster with a heart racing bone-marrow and madeira sauce – Tom’s idea of a surf and turf.

Tom extrapolates the chaud-froid effect with a super clean milk sorbet, passionfruit gel and pump street chocolate thats been fried to a crispy sub-cooled temperature by liquid nitrogen (which he also inherits from Matt G).

Ultimately it’s a dish that embraces flavour, and was satisfying way to end the savouries. I prefer my lamb on the bone of course, but the extra piece of lamb belly on skewers made up for the lost bone gnawing. They were banging.

Hot/Cold chocolate variations with milk sorbet and passionfruit gel Tom inherited the open kitchen from Gillan’s days (still seen here while he gets his new gig going), the restaurant is relatively small, a couple steps from the banquette high tables to his pass, so there is a sense you’re almost in there. He also inherited liquid nitrogen, nice crockery,all part of the genesis, or shall we say the presentation of it, as he summoned us to into the kitchen for pudding …and I thought i’d never see the day Kembler did modernist. Jack is on pastry, turn it up 🔊 , you’ll hear Tom give a quick run down of the dish as Jack prepares it. An homage to @sportsmankent Stephen Harris’ warm chocolate mousse (also iSi whipper) with milk ice cream, & ongoing development with @pumpstreetchocolate (72%Bourbon mousse) , with a very clean milk sorbet from his Bonhams days (made with creme crue, which I love). – Firstly, the pudding is gorgeous in its simplicity – and a very pure milk chocolate. Chaud/froid study of contrasting temperatures, warm mousse to ice cold cream to nitro cold crumble (so to speak). Served in a bowl, the whole thing yields pure satisfaction – the spoon eases in smooth, snappy tuile then mousse(swipe 👉). I mopped it up in seconds. A true pud. I generally avoid a heavy chocolate, but this is notable in that you get the sinful comfort, but come away with a light finish. Secondly, and perhaps more so, the interaction works especially well for this one. Rather than for show, Tom’s used the nitrogen to refry the chocolate, so there is an element of la minute prep that’s integral to the eating experience. As the dining room is so close, its easy for people to pop into the kitchen to see their pud being put together, and it totally works well as a finale to the taster menu. Also, notice Tom casually showing off his perfect rochers, two in a row.🌟..🌟. Hope Stephen tries this one day, I’m pretty sure he’ll be pretty happy with it.

While it is vogue for today’s European based chefs to borrow (heavily) from the Japanese (dashis, vinegars, seaweed), Jeremy Chan has chosen an altogether different route to peak umami via Jollof cuisine. It might be highly presumptuous of me to offer Jeremy as the modern day version of Olivier Roellinger; classic techniques with a growing knowledge of spices… though quite some way before Chan reaches Roellinger’s legend status.

I had wondered if these were the flavours of Nigerian cuisine, albeit dressed up for London palates, or if it was modern European accented by African spices. Without a reference point and having never been to Africa, it was all an education for me. My impression last year was that the spicing was a little over the top and he could perhaps pay some attention to balancing the dishes – a little salt here and a little acidity there, let’s say universal things that constitute delicious.

Frankly it was a joy and somewhat of a surprise to see London chefs paying this much attention to the actual cookery of products all in a single meal, outside of the established places, Ledbury, Hedone and the Greenhouse. The respect and love for the ingredient was clear, translating into exacting raising to the right temperatures.

These guys have not stood still, and have indeed continually developed the cuisine and refined their craft. What a meal this was, and in London no less, with beautiful British produce. A triumph and every bit worthy of the Michelin star that the Bib has awarded to Jeremy and team.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/13/ikoyi-london-2019-2018/|Due to location, Ikoyi is most definitely not cheap, but you do get what you paid for. The normal taster menu is currently £75pp, the extended normally advertised as £100pp, but my menu costed £120pp. If in doubt, ask before you order.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/13/ikoyi-london-2019-2018/|Saying all this, I wholeheartedly recommend you to give Ikoyi a spin and go with an open mind. Leave aside any preconceived notions of what you think the cuisine here is. For me, I think of it as Modern European with Nigerian spices and vegetables, but the terroir is most definitely British, and it makes this very much a London restaurant. The guys have been chipping away at their little project for about 2 years now, and I think Jeremy has now begun shaping something that is both delicious and uniquely his own. Not so easy to stand out in this realm with so much Gastronomic history already cataloged today, but Jeremy and Iré have just about pulled it off.

If you weren’t told, you wouldn’t know it was brain at all. This is someone who has the genius to assemble these flavours and textures together into a singular bite bursting with satisfying savouriness. Primary tastes of salty, sweet, contrast of crispy starch and creamy sauce, it’s a smart dish, surprising, exciting, simple and unique all at the same time. Jeremy, this is a winner. Everybody should go and eat this in the Spring while morels are still around to savour it.

Franco was on side with Claude on their side of the pass, and Marcus Jenmark headed the other side.

On paper it’s three humble ingredients, the onion being the starting point for almost everything, but the way he’s decided to cook the ingredients, bring them together, and his choice of textural contrasts resulted in a riveting experience of seemingly unending layer upon layer of interchanging savouriness, acidity, sweetness, salty, luxurious creaminess, incredibly all with the flavours of the primary products.

A fairly fresh and pure style, with a touch of oxidative nuttiness to match the roasted nuts in the dish. The rainwater refers to way it is made, barrels left uncorked, allowing rainwater to seep and lighten the wine. Top drop by Carl Frosterud.

I love potatoes, in all the various prep, including as raw noodles, and this was something new that I could add to my taste memories. It really was superiorly comforting, the ultimate comfort food feels, leave me in a room with a spoon and couple of bowls of this, I would happily polish it all off and ask for more. To cut the richness, there is a dose of acidity, which I assume is from the mead gel, and a little freshness from citrus zest. Topped with the best cut of chicken, two nuggets from it’s back. To make something so special from humble ingredients. Stunning dish!

There’s a light persistent spice, tempered by acidity, the firm trout roe and the sheer natural sweetness of the king crab.

I’ve seen Passard’s duck and coffee sauce, as well as Phil Howard’s beef ribs and espresso, never ate either, but there is no question that coffee has its place in savoury dishes.

The texture was loose, very tender and juicy. In terms of flavour, the coffee imparted a light acidity, and who knew that coffee harmonised so well with beef. Fillet being rather neutral in flavour was absolutely the right cut to infuse with flavour.

If I am to be honest, personally, the coffee sauce seemed excessive, as a light jus with some more freshness would have sufficed for me, though it didn’t detract from the brilliance of the protein itself. It was seriously a pristinely cooked tenderloin. Beef so often is a boring choice for a taster menu, but not this one. A bold dish!

The coconut and white chocolate are the dominating flavours, the savoury elements there to create contrast with the sweet, and the overall profile then morphs into something redolent of kaya. With the texture of rolled coconut flesh, this experience reminded me of the varied flavours of “Tong Sui” 糖水, which depending on who makes it would feature a myriad of ingredients you wouldn’t think should be in pudding. If you know Hibiscus, then you know Claude has never been afraid to push the boundaries. In this case, a genius move that paid off tremendously. I loved it. Superb finish to a memorable collaboration. If you see this on the menu, take the plunge.

Quality costs money, otherwise nobody would take up a career doing this stuff. I’d like to be rewarded if I was good at my job. Also I went with 3 mates, so technically it’s 41 x £10 – cost of meal for myself. Still, it is cheaper than travelling to Stockholm, as well as having a meal at Bosi and Frantzen separately.

The meal also featured all other cuts including round, ribeye cap, tail, shank, chuck, ribeye, sirloin, fillet and its prized fat (in an old fashioned no less). Hamada san’s Ozaki (as in Mr Ozaki’s beef to be exact. The only beef in Japan that carries its farmer’s name) and 2017 grandprix Kobe were phenomenal.

Steve Drake is someone whose been round the block, yet because he has operated outside of London for most of his career as head chef, he has remained relatively under the radar, even though this seasoned, talented Chef is anything but when it comes to his cooking chops. A Roux scholar, he has trained under many a legend in British gastronomy, including at Chez Nico, The Oak Room with MPW and has had stints with Alain Passard and at L’Auberge de L’Eridan in France.

The endive I’m told has been firstly cooked in some local Dorking ale, and presumably charred to finished. Ive always found that browned endive’s flavour is very close to that of truffle, and it really went a long way to pump up the -let’s say- more humble tuber of the season, together serving as the earthy backbone of the dish. The rest of the dish provides the salt, and those plums brought the fireworks in the acidity department. Sophiscated stuff for sure.

Glimmering nacre, and beautiful translucent flakes all over. I love the disc of smoked marrow, it adds meatiness to compliment the fish’s clean flavour.

He is a practitioner of classic cuisine but like many things in the land of the Rising Sun, the soul of this restaurant is very much Japanese, with his craft directed at expressing the very best of the many jewels of Japanese terroir, rather than to simply import fish from Brittany.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|Kawate san has had his entire career immersed in French cuisine, starting out under a Chef named Masahiko Ohara, who plies his trade in Roppongi. After that, he went onto Le Bourguignon also in the vicinity, and then jetting off to stint at Le Jardin des Sens in Montpellier. After returning to Japan, he went to work for Shuzo Kishida of the hallowed Quintessence before finally opening Florilege in 2009. Kawate had moved his restaurant in 2015 (the former space now occupied by the brilliant
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|, also helmed by Quintessence alumnus) to the currently roomier and expansive open kitchen counter table dining room. Entering his 10th year as chef patron, he also welcomes a fresh michelin star win for his second act in Taipei called Logy.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|The notion of the crew opening in Taipei, to work with the excellent but underrated Taiwanese terroir, was music to my ears. Given that I was in both countries for this trip, i grabbed the chance to experience both restaurants back to back. Kawate san has entrusted logy’s slick open counter kitchen – mirroring Florilege’s own – to Ryogo Tahara, his former sous for the last 3 years, naming it to signify the blending of Asian culture, grounded in Taiwanese soil. You can read up their
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|on how they finally decided to call it that, though most conveniently, logy phonetically is similar to roji; Japanese for alley way, which is where you will find the restaurant in Da’an district. Like Florilege, Tahara san’s cuisine is modern and unique, yet it is realised mostly through classic technique and showcases his ongoing study of the riches of Taiwanese produce.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|Both restaurants only do taster menus, logy’s is carte blanche (for 3750NT / £95pp), Florilege’s menu give vague descriptions of the courses. Each menu is about the same length, 6-7 savouries and 3 puddings. Florilege has an additional shorter lunch menu, 6 courses for 7500yen /£55, though we opted for the long one (15000yen / £110). It is worth mentioning that Florilege has an excellent option for a soft pairing flight. I chose it, and its variety of tea, sparkling juices and fruit/veg extractions all carefully made by the barman to compliment each dish is superb.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|Both chefs spend the majority of service on the stoves, especially with the meat courses, all slowly grilled and then finished on the pan prior to plating up. The skill is evident, all delivered on hot plates -as it should be for work this fine- with both chefs pursuing their own unique creations, molded around the seasons. In both cases I was very impressed with how both Kawate and Tahara had each masterfully weaved together a coherent retelling of the terroir they were working with. It was clear that their kitchens are fertile ground for the mentoring of fine craftsmen, and perhaps potential star chefs of the future. Florilege was definitely the more established act of the pair, their two star rating more than justified in terms of the kitchen’s technical prowess.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|Although totally different, Florilege does feel like a Tokyo parallel of my own beloved Ledbury here in London, somewhat kindred spirits in the way they view gastronomy. Both men are classically trained but shun French products, instead eagerly direct their attention to the locality around them, concerned about food waste (Brett makes compost from his kitchen waste, which punters can take home, which I have on a few occasions for our garden) and both are especially gifted in identifying value in otherwise unloved ingredients or cuts by transforming them into something unexpectedly special.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|In Brett’s case, he makes ethereal carpaccio slices by clay cooking irregularly oversized beetroots that are usually binned by farmers. Meanwhile Kawate san makes a luscious cold shabu-shabu from the loin of cows which have given birth to calves – meat that would never grace the menu of fine Japanese steak houses which -amongst other things- demand virgin cows. There is a lot to admire when a chef is able to raise noble produce to new heights of course, but it takes true genius to make something out of nothing.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|Finally some words on the younger restaurant, logy and it certainly intrigues me because Tahara san is only at the outset of his Taiwanese odyssey. As I mentioned earlier, Taiwan is bursting at the seams with quality produce that is only beginning to get the global coverage it deserves. There is much untapped potential yet as I am sure Tahara san will continue to develop as he discovers and codifies more creations using Taiwanese produce. The man is young and enthusiastic and I have no doubt we will hear more of logy’s rising star in the years to come.

For our sitting, the cow was 11 years old at slaughter, its loin cut about half an inch thick, lightly cured by air drying, then left to marinade in beef stock in the fridge, which also features in the richly flavoured cold consommé in the eventual dish. It sits on potato puree pushed through an iSi whipper, and finished with herb oil at the table. The dish is finely made, with classic, well balanced beef and mash flavours. It has the sensation of cold shabu-shabu, the cure redolent of Spanish cecina, the moisture draw limited, reducing the beef to an attractive, slightly bouncy chew, and a subtle beefiness that persists. The overall palate is satisfying savouriness. Objective achieved: Things we throw away can be every bit two star delicious.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|Back to the topic of food waste, it is intriguing to think about how it differs one country to another. While in Japan, people pay top yen for the aforementioned beef from virgin wagyu; throughout Europe, it is older cows (incl ex-dairy) which are sought after for both flavour (high b-carotene fat and tremendous marbling) and texture.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|Meanwhile in the UK, we have Rose veal that is both ethical and delicious. Bull calves, i.e., half the births are literal by-products of milk production. They live for at least a year on grass, before slaughtering for beef – as opposed to simply shooting them at birth.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/21/florilege-tokyo-logy-taipei/|Outside of beef, there’s perception of what is deemed prime cut. Where one cuisine might prize say fish heads (cheek, throat, eye, collar) and poultry thighs, others don’t think twice about chucking in stock. Ultimately the best chefs r resourceful, and tend to respect whole animals, the gift of terroir, which I suppose is the spirit of gastronomy.

Spontaneity and creativity reign supreme, Passard and his kitchen still immensely spirited in their practice of gastronomy at the highest levels, they continue to introduce new dishes to their menu, not bad for a restaurant now in its 33rd year. As usual, Tony Beldroega was in charge of the affairs today, with the Chef himself making an appearance mid-way through lunch to greet punters. I had wanted to try Alain’s latest Frankenstein creation, the Chimera, pigeon stiched together with a rack of lamb, but alas it wasn’t on the menu on this visit.

The food here is fine in its eating, while the dishes are beautiful to look at, the kitchen spends the majority cooking rather than plating little things perfectly. Some people do not like it for this very reason, but I love L’Arpege because at the heart of it all, the restaurant is about pure cooking, slow grilled proteins cooked grand and whole, and daring la minute preparations for everything else. It might seem counter intuitive to say this, but in today’s world of foraged, water bath modernism, L’Arpege is in the minority when it comes to actually delivering hot food on piping hot plates. A pre-requisite as it always should be for any fine food that is cooked with love and respect!
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/|When you visit, it really is worth spending some time to study all their menus deeply, and then to make sure you speak up and ask for anything you want to try. They can mix and match anything on their menus, and also stuff that’s not on their menus. I cannot stress this enough, if you simply leave it up to them, chances are you will almost definitely be disappointed and wonder what the fuss is all about. These guys love a challenge believe me, the more bespoke your menu is, the better the meal becomes. It’s going to  cost an arm and leg regardless of what you do, so if you’ve made up your mind to go here, then do like Magnus Nilsson when he left L’Astrance and do it in style.

This was a pretty big lobster, looks 1kg mark. It’s massive claw and knuckle on the other hand came out just right.

I thought blue lobster from ‘Brittany’ area is available all year long (e.g. you always find a lobster dish at L’Ambroisie)

But Lobsters in the English Channel between Dorset and Brittany are at their best around the summer, starting from say June and run till August. July is probably the most plentiful month, and prices are cheapest. I did have the lobster vin jaune in November last year.

Passard with his Breton roots of course serves the pre-sale lamb from Mont St Michel. It is truly a privilege to taste the meat in its peak (contrary to marketing of lamb in Spring without having grazed on grass in the winter), salt marsh lamb season actually starts after July and continues into February.

With no hard edges, all flavour and texture harmoniously blend to singularly create this sumptuous comfort effect with each spoonful.

The plate comes piping hot, with the shaved Bernard Antony Comte becoming a mixture of crumbly and soft edges just melting on to the sauce, all the while lending its saltiness to season the dish. This subtle dish basically keeps itself in check to accentuate and harness the precious aromas of white truffle; subtle but persistent, and of course intoxicating. Produce, technique and class – it’s one of those that produce the sort of magic headiness because of how balanced Passard’s cuisine is when it is expressing flavour in its purest form.

And for me, it is where the romantic notion of Chef’s ‘feeling’ and timing comes into the picture. The FOH presents the turbot to the table on a silver platter prior to carving. Some gentle hands required to keep this in one piece during the cooking/flipping as is, especially a big boy this big, which must looks at least 6kg, eyeballing it.

While I prefer fillet top neck from the dark-side, the cuisson was naturally wonderful – juicy, flaky, a little sweet (since it’s the white-side) and gelatinous.

Of course, Passard’s great gift in his composition of ingredients, guided by instinct in finessing the overall flavours so they knit together, but also ensuring that purity of natural flavour is always at the fore.

As is the hallmark of Breton lobsters, the tail has bite and bounce in texture. And finally, you discover the true brilliance with a sip of that superlative vin jaune sauce. Its layers beautifully built up giving way to a kind of vitality as it hits the palate. The sweet, the gastrique, the silky mouthfeel, ridiculous perfection, of which there is (almost) no equal.

But it wasn’t. It was a beautiful pairing, proving the adage, “what grows together, goes together.” The whisky seasoned by the local salt spray matched the saltiness of the oyster pulled from local Islay waters, and the smokiness meshed with the oysters’ oceanic tang. You like smoked oysters, right? Smoky whisky and oysters yield the same combination of flavors.

We tried the pairing of Kumamoto and Blue Point oysters with Oban 10 year old Scotch whisky, distilled oceanside in Scotland and evincing the brininess that works so well with oysters. Oban lacks the peaty intensity of Ardbeg, enhancing the oyster flavor without peatiness. With slight salinity seasoning both Oban whisky and the oyster, the flavor of the sea creature seemed to come through even more clearly. Conclusion: both peaty and un-peated Scotch whisky pairs well with oysters.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.diningchicago.com|http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/|For a tartare made with salmon harvested in the Faroe Islands (about 200 miles north of Scotland), we switched to a 10-year-old Macallan. A Speyside whisky distilled far away from the peat fields of Islay, Macallan has no notes of peat at all, which seemed like the right choice for a fish of this quality. The light Dijon sauce and capers matched the relative lightness of the Scotch. This was a superbly balanced pairing.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.diningchicago.com|http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/|Scallops also made a very good pairing with the Macallan, the light and sweet sherry notes of the whisky, aged in sherry barrels, was a very pleasant match for the light, sweet flavor of the scallops.

When we visit again, we’ll get the Angus beef cap with our Ardbeg but take a pass on this tangy green South American sauce, which we’ve had before and liked a lot, but which is not a friendly pairing with Scotch.

It’s one of the area’s most popular places to frequent for larger groups because many dishes are share-able. Guests should start off with one of the ceviches, which consist of camaron (tiger shrimp), huachinago (red snapper) and Mahi Mahi. Tacos are the most popular item to order at La Josie. Choose from al pastor (adobo pork), carnitas (baked pork shoulder), grilled Amish chicken or asada (grilled skirt steak). Other shareables include entrees like pollo rostizado of oven-roasted Amish chicken, black beans and Mexican rice or parrillada of grilled skirt steak, chicken breast, house-made chorizo, grilled veggies and rajas poblanos. The beverage menu ranges from a mezcal Old Fashioned to craft beers on draft.

Ironside’s recreation of Peach Pit After Dark features themed dishes and drinks (“Mrs. Teasley’s Mac and Cheese (Order it with lobster because you’re in Beverly Hills, after all!),” “Brandon Walsh Cherry Chocolate Manhattan”), life-sized cutouts of the characters, a deejay spinning music from the 1990s, “90201” episodes playing throughout the space and more.

Chef Mark Steuer—formerly of Carriage House, El Che Bar and Hot Chocolate—merges his heritage with his new restaurant in West Town. He skillfully combines Southern accents with German classics on the menu at Funkenhausen. Think ricotta dumplings filled with kielbasa, gooseberries and oyster mushrooms; veal schnitzel with baby squash; and charred broccolini in buttermilk dressing. It gets even better as the soundtrack consists of classic and contemporary funk during service.

Of the pair of steamed buns, I enjoyed the one with fried cheese and tapioca pearls with curry and fermented chilli. The fried cheese gooey, and the pearls go crispy like crispy rice – gorgeous. Though, all three buns were greasy, all came with deep fried elements. The steamed buns were a little dry during this visit, compared to other Baos, which I will chalk down as teething problems.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/06/06/the-sea-the-sea/|for the last time in February this year. It was one of my favourite new openings in London, as it stood apart from the mass market IG-friendly model, here was a Chef interested in developing a cuisine and identity that was uniquely his own. It was Portuguese, but modern, textured and charged with acidity in the way say Taiwanese cuisine is (however unintentional) and reaching his end goals with classic technique, but slowed all the way down, long ageing his proteins, fermenting and also slow cooking his vegetables through application of very low heat sometimes over weeks. You guys are well versed with Japan and France, but the flavours that excited Leo were altogether less common in London. During this time, I witnessed some incredible new combinations and layering of flavours which I’d not seen anywhere else before. Though there were a few things that pushed the boundaries even for me, on the whole however, it was an experience visiting Leo, as there was always something different on the table. I thought then that perhaps it was only time required for London to catch up with Leo’s creativity, but alas Leo decided to call time on it. Location and size didn’t help as foot fall was nearly non-existent, and that was the dagger that closed Londrino’s doors 18 months later.

Sited at Pavillion road in the fringes of Chlesea…. a little like Chelsea’s version of Spa Terminus.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/06/06/the-sea-the-sea/|Leo’s role here is as Executive Chef for the food menu (which is to say he’s not here everyday), though expectedly he brings with him some of his ex-staff from Londrino. The major difference between then and now is that he and his kitchen team are now handicapped in terms of kit, as compared to the spaceship laboratory kitchen that was Londrino. But such is the irony of life, sometimes less is more. With only a couple of portable hobs to steam shellfish and a few blowtorches to aburi and to quick smoke fillets, it has channeled Leo’s creativity in a focused manner, resulting in some smart, simple but no less creative dishes.

As mentioned, there are no stoves here, it is very much like Leo’s sushi ya, you’ll see him shucking oysters, dishing up his crudos, showcasing his tsukemono (all pickled in house) and opening up fillets of fish which he dry ages over salt right here in the shop.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/06/06/the-sea-the-sea/|There is something special about this place. Maybe it’s because of the kitchen limits, perhaps it is that Alex himself is also committed to the site. Like a pet project, it has great energy, the simplicity of their food menu exactly the right counterpoint and confines for Leo to apply his intervention. Most of all at the sharp end of the business, it fits right in the neighborhood. If you love the odd seafood binge with your bubbly, you might like it here, and also be pleasantly surprised encountering the occasional flavour pairing revelation in Leo’s various cold preps.

Led by Leo, giving commentary as he killed, cooked and prepared the dishes live and on the spot for an small group of 8 (strangers). It was intimate, priced well (£120pp all in, including booze and service), respectful of the mighty native lobster, now in peak season, and it was banging. The first of many I’m sure, well worth your time going to one.

Blows my mind how Leo manages to create all these dishes, the layering of flavours, textures, non conventional but all grounded in extracting max umami.

After shelling the tail and claws, he cut the tail and claws up into large chunks. The frontal tails were roughly chopped up – with traces of green from its coral – like a tartare and placed this at the bottom of each plate. The rest of the tail and claws were returned to the pot for one final steam prior to plating up, with all the residual juices also poured into the plate.

Like anything of notable quality, it is always about the people and Mendes had the pick of the crop come through his kitchens (and still does at Maos). A few have gone on to make a name for themselves, I think mainly of Leo Carreira, and at least one guy has gone back home to open arguably one of the most exciting restaurants in Lisbon – Prado.

What remains the same however is a respect for classic technique and if anything it requires mastery of fundamental craft before you start riffing off new ideas (David Chang was on to something all those years ago).

Sure, I too admire the 80s golden age of Nouvelle masters (and still do, the last bastions L’Ambroisie and L’Arpege are still apex), much like now, those pioneering French chefs in their heyday also sought to break new ground in with minimalist and natural flavours, in place of heavy butter and roux.

The design is lovely with unbroken, smooth Scandi lines and it is split across two spaces.

It is supremely well made katsu, brightened with a joltingly fresh sweet/savoury jam, the TaTa version of a tart katsu sauce. Undoubtedly delicious, as London has already attested to, though I did feel that the crusty brioche to be a jarring contrast. I get why he’s gone for a crusty bread, as this is in fact Meng’s take on Bifana, born from a collab dinner with Prado Restaurante early last year. Personally, I think milk bread is the choice bread for a fully melt-in-your-mouth sandwich. All about the soft textures, though that is more fittingly  Japanese in spiritm than a Portuguese sando. Saying that, I get the hype, it is legit.

To balance, he’s composed an earthy broth to match the grassy funk, popped barley for texture and wild strabs to pull in freshness and acidity. It comes together like clockwork on the palate – a dance of richness and lightness. The Chef has an instinctual palate, creating a taste that is both familiar and new at the same time. Top notch.

Right now, Meng relies on a single portable induction hob for source of heat. The show must go on of course, as with any good chef, he’s resourceful and adapted his craft to suit his tools at hand. Which is to say, there is even more to come when his grill gets up to speed 🔥!

Then prior to carving, Chef placed it skin side down on a hot pan. Juicy like a water balloon, bags of flavour, melting tender, and the fat disintegrates like cotton candy on the palate. Seasoned with salt and a superb spice mix consisting of cumin, coriander seeds, sesame, dried seaweed amongst other things, which acted to foil and contrast the fat.

Alongside Claude Bosi and Brett Graham, IMHO, these are the three guys currently sitting at the very apex of London gastronomy.

His cuisine is one of modernity, subtlety and clarity. Decidedly French with flourishes of Asian influence in a non-intrusive way (quite unlike say Barbot’s love of citrus-charged flavours), his lightness of touch across the dishes is inspired stuff and I find it extremely appealing.

In the evening, there is the epic 8 course which can be had for 320euroes. I went for the 6 courses plus the white truffle supplement (60euroes), and arranged a little wine flight comprised of Haut Brion’s 2nd wines and their non first growth labels.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/11/29/le-clarence-paris/|Every course here is delivered as sequential multi-plates a la Gagnaire, and as a surprise. In some regard, the spontaneity of Pele’s creative cuisine feels much like a grand version of Parisian bistronomy, played out in a most opulent setting. I think it is every bit worthy of its two star rating and I would compare Pele’s idea of a carte blanche to that of Passage 53. Both Chefs’ frame their menus around a string of balanced and light dishes that flow from the start to finish.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/11/29/le-clarence-paris/|What really makes Le Clarence rather unique of course are that you can opt for the HM and LMHB first wines – both the whites and the reds – by the glass, and indeed fashion a wine flight based around them. They would still cost a ton, at 130 – 200 euroes a glass, but not thousands if you were to pop the cork on 4 bottles of each of the white and red Graves.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/11/29/le-clarence-paris/|Is it a candidate for 3 stars today? Probably not, as I feel that Pele is still tweaking his ideas about Cantonese flavours in his cuisine. Also, a couple of docked points for presenting tourists with a sub-standard white truffle that is at the moment (mid Nov 2019) showing very well near its peak season. However as it stands, his cuisine is very attractive, the cuisson is generally spot-on and I would love to revisit to see how he is progressing in due time.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|Small and beautiful situated in leafy Holland Park – a change from exciting East London prospects – and only newly trading since Spring. The team are mostly an exodus of Terroir alumni, led out West by owner Oli Barker (after he split from the Terroirs group). In the kichen, Pascal Weidemann lays on a simple yet decidedly considered menu using good ingredients – both raw and preserved – and cooked with heart and soul. Exactly the sort of thing that is conjured, when you think of hidden gems.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|I remain a big fan of Phil Howard, initially shocked that he decided to sell The Square, but now glad that Elystan Street has got off to a flying start. The price tag attached to the dinner menu looks a little scary, but that is why you should drop in for lunch. I for one am keen on his Sunday roasts, from what I’ve
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|Two visits in the first couple of weeks trading showed that Phil has lost none of his ability. He may be actively paring down his cuisine, but it is inevitable that the old Square magic will leak through. Like this smoked mackerel dish for example, a simplification of his 2012 GBM winner. ?% deliciousness.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|I am pleasantly surprised by the quality from this restaurant attached to a salvage yard. Led by chefs Jackson Boxer and Andrew Clarke, they have crafted a constantly changing menu, sensitive to seasons and unshackled from tradition. Priced incredibly well, all the while delivering tasty food inside an interesting decor of mostly reconditioned trinkets. I have visited 5 times in the last quarter, each meal something different and each bite a delight, like the above pairing of texturally exciting chopped bavette with a puree from blitzed mussels.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|This is the Bib’s pick for pub of the year and I think is a fully deserving accolade, if not also a full star to be restored to the co chef-owners, Tom Harris and Jon Rotherham, both ex-St John Hotel.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|Of puddings this year, the brown butter and honey tart is hands down my favourite. From the impossibly thin architecture of the pastry base to the gravity defying wobble of the custard – exacting and sensational patisserie. It tastes great too.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|They are a little understaffed for the moment, and turn over an incredible number of tables on Sundays, so just be wary that you may end up with an inconsistent meal. When they have the time to be on their game however, all of it is straight fire.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|I love Paris for gastronomy and bistronomy and in 2016, I think they (still) do it better than we do in London, on both sides of the bank. Of the ones that stood out for me was without question Hideki Nishi’s Summer Snow. The ex-Taillevent Chef works with the best of French produce, applying precision classic technique with just the right dose of Japanese heritage. Like this beautiful pork loin, grilled on the bone over Japanese bincho coals. SO delicious. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nishi san gets promoted by the Bib sometime in the near future. For me, it is a restaurant I must include on every trip to Paris.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|One of my all time favourites in The Smoke. David O’Connor and Joe Mercer-Nairn’s restaurant turned 5 this year, and is as strong as ever. The bib may have forsaken them, baffling because dishes like above stand head and shoulders above some starred restaurants in town. Although the lack of a star is probably a blessing in disguise. Five years on, it is still the best money (£35 for 3) you can spend anywhere for a decent lunch in London. If you have never been, now is the time to make it happen.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|I’ve been a Lee Westcott fan since his head chef days for Tom Aikens (at Elystan Street). And like Tom, this guy is quite the gifted chef, able to finesse seemingly humble ingredients into higher planes, through modernist methods as well as the naturalism of New Nordic to deliver a solid idea of what Modern British cuisine ought to look like. This Spring expression of Devon crab for instance simply dances on the palate. Where is the bib on him, I wonder.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|And indeed it was, delivered across two plates. First, as roasted tail to a perfect mi-cuit and secondly with its knuckles folded into a ravioli. Both with full-flavoured bisques, each distinctly spiced from the other. I visited twice, the first was a Bretagne blue, the second a Cornish blue. Both times were fantastic. A little more than the lo-key brasserie image I think. The Chef is one Rapheal Grima, from the two meals I ate here, this guy looks serious about making Les110 a splash in London. At these prices and for this sort of execution, I’ll gladly eat live native lobsters in its own stock all day long. Two more please.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|Even more fun than it looks. Tucked away in a North West London pub is the talented Jesse Dunford Wood and whilst his standard menu at the pub is more than decent, it is his Chef’s table that’s special. For £70pp, Jesse will feed you, and feed you, tell you some stories, display his sabrage skills and finish the show with a nod/wink to that other guy who also worked for Charlie Trotter, or a dessert bar in Hong Kong depending on where you read it first.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|This probably qualifies as one of the most delicious things London has to offer. Available on Saturdays mornings only.

I have to say I was bowled over by this crab dish, one reason why I thought the meal at Hedone this year was several notches above last year’s. Such purity of flavour, such respect for the ingredients – two types of crab Devon cock and (invisible) tiny velvet swimmer crab – something like this has to be cooked a la minute with absolutely the freshest and best you can get your hands on. The result is perfection. Perhaps the clearest representation of Mikael’s style of cuisine I’ve yet tasted. Like Medlar, Hedone also celebrates 5 years in the business, whilst gaining an international profile along the way. Quite some work Mikael and Aurelie have achieved in this time.

Kanto/East/Tokyo style slits open the wriggler from the back, and the cooking process includes a steaming step, in addition to skewering, grilling and finishing with sweet tare sauce over bincho charcoal.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|Where as the Kansai/West/Osaka style slits from belly (like ‘harakiri’ and because Samurais are mostly in Kanto) and the cooking skips the steaming, and therefore leads to crispier skin, like crackling, generally a better ‘sealing effect’.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|The latter is sometimes referred to as being the more masculine style, the meat is firmer and more robust, more flavour, as it has not been softened by a steaming step.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|I’m hardly the unagi expert, but I’m willing to take a punt and suggest that Umu’s unagi is prepped Kanto style, but grilled Kansai style. This I speculate is due in part to Chef Yoshinori Ishii’s training, beginning in Osaka and then moving on to the revered Kitcho in Kyoto.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|For me, this is an incredible take on British freshwaters and one in which Ishii san has applied his considerable talents to adapt his cuisine to local produce, not to mention his efforts in bringing ikejime to the shores of Cornwall.

Meaty, fleshy, full of natural oiliness, comprehensively unctuous. Undoubtedly the best unagi I have had outside of Japan and unbelievably, this is unique to Britain because of the native eel. Reasons why he holds a brace of stars.

I think I’m on my 14th visit and each meal better than the last. Intensely seasonal produce is the point, with the Chef intervening to deliver maximum natural flavour. It takes quite some skill to do simplicity and in Chef Tom Kemble and sous Theo Clench, we have a cuisine that excels in the classy, subtle and delicate.

But this year in 2017, I think he’s managed to find reinvention and further refinement in his cooking. Minor but significant tweaks to his perfect dishes, here and there, and all of it stacks up to something rather quite spectacular. For me, The Ledbury is the yardstick for Modern Gastronomy in London, fundamentals, handling of quality seasonal produce and the hallmark Front of House that walks the line of casual-slickness. For me, The Ledbury is the best of 2017.

restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|When people ask me what piece of kit I have in my kitchen that I love and would recommend, there are a few contenders. Firstly, every home cook just needs to start with a good knife, a wooden spoon, a chopping board and a heavy pan. Beyond this, I rely heavily on my mixer, food processor and my pressure cooker.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|A pressure cooker was not something that I thought that I would ever want. As with many people I have terrifying memories of pressure cookers that seemed to hiss and dance and threaten to explode. The veg cooked inside – always veg – were limp and lifeless. The flavour all gone with the hiss and the steam scream, leaving pale carrot batons and burst potatoes.

I lightened this one a bit, basing it in a light garlicky broth with beans (chickpeas, but use whatever bean you like), streaky bacon, crumbled sausage, cavolo nero, a pinch of chilli and a twist on gremolata on top.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|Let’s talk about gremolata! I love it and it is perfect for brightening things, especially anything meaty, like a rich slow cooked ragu. It is simply lemon zest, flat leaf parsley and raw garlic. Chopped and chopped and chopped together, until really fine. I said this was a twist, and so it was. I used preserved lemon and added some chilli also. It really lifted the bowl.

You can get these in any Chinese food store, usually in small plastic bags or a yellow cardboard tub. Fermented foods are a way of borrowing time from before and adding fast flavour. How lovely is that? I soaked the beans briefly and then simply blitzed all of the ingredients together, then cooked it for 10 minutes. Done!

It is luscious and rich and is used to great effect in many food cultures, notably Japanese cuisine. In Japan cod and pollock roe are cured with chilli and called mentaiko.

Our soda bread is milk based, many things are. We are obsessed with butter, we even put it on our biscuits.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|Cork has a rich dairy history. It was once home to the most important butter market in the UK and Ireland. Launched in 1730, at its peak in the 1880s it was handling 500,000 casks of butter per year valued at £1.5million. People travelled from all over the world to Cork to trade butter. It is for this reason that there are recipes like Spiced Beef in Cork as the spices were traded for butter. It closed later as European butter markets competed, and in the area where it once thrived there is now Cork Butter Museum. A curious small place packed with butter paraphernalia and history including an ancient barrel of bog butter. Butter was our primary source of fat and therefore stored energy for the lean months of winter. We are still obsessed.

The cap of fat is both full in its honey gold in colour as well as in flavour, signs of its healthy diet of grass. Meanwhile the meat is notably tender, and well marbled, with a rather pure and subtly sweet flavour. Jeremy remarked later that it is for this reason, he see potential to push the dry age and develop its flavour. In terms of the cook, I really love the crispy and rendered fat, gorgeous, and I thought he chose the right temperature of meat (if I had to guess, I’d say 120F?) for natural flavour, with zero juice loss.

The cuisson is spot on, all the gelatinous bits sliding off the bone, and given the rich natural flavours, the spices do amazing things to temper it. I’d go as far to say it’s the best fish head I’ve had in London. Comes close to many childhood memories of fish head curries back home.

The turbot tranche was served with an aromatic squid ink sauce, but given the potency, it did overwhelm as I worked into the dish. I think it needs just some more salt and a touch of acidity for balance. Though it didn’t detract from the overall epicness of this spread of Turbot. Who needs a tasting menu when this noble fish is served like this for £60.

Keep the group party going with one of Caffe Oliva’s fish bowls, designed to satisfy a thirsty group with potions like the “Finding Nemo”: blueberry vodka, pineapple juice, sour, fresh lemon juice and Swedish fish.

This beloved mini-chain is popular for good reason, and their Streeterville location (the only one in city limits) backs it all up with the added bonus of being right on the Ogden Slip harbor, with a lengthy fire pit-lined patio overlooking the lake. In addition to bowling and bocce inside, Pinstripes sets itself apart as a restaurant destination in and of itself, with casual yet inventive Italian food that’s great both for snacking-while-gaming and for a leisurely meal al fresco or indoors.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.diningchicago.com|http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/|: For upscale Italian fare with an equally impressive vista, don’t miss Cafe Spiaggia. Or really if you’re feeling decadent, it’s even more upscale sister restaurant Spiaggia. But due to its more accessible offerings, Cafe Spiaggia is certainly an easier stopover for a quick lunch with a sensational overlooking the top of the Magnificent Mile and Oak Street Beach. The restaurant offers a contemporary, elegant take on classic Italian cuisine, making for a fine meal while nestled along the windows above one of the most famous shopping streets in the country.

The South Loop outpost of the boil-in-a-bag seafood concept, which specializes in Cajun-style shellfish, has added weekend brunch to its popular portfolio. A slight departure from its usual eat-with-your-hands bag-centric menu, the brunch offerings span a spectrum of Southern comforts, from fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese to snow crab cake Benedict, biscuits and gravy, shrimp and grits and chicken and waffles. Of course those seafood boils will still be available as an option, filled with customizable provisions like sausage, crab and shrimp. Cheesy grits, honey butter cornbread and garlic beignets are available as sides. For something sweet, opt for the deep-fried Oreos, and wash it all down with a mimosa, Bloody Mary or a quenching highball. Brunch is served Saturdays and Sundays from noon until 3:00 p.m.

Now, the glitzy Gold Coast bastion has added breakfast and brunch, providing even more opportunities to sample the decadence. The weekday breakfast menu consists of various toasts (avocado, tahini-banana-honey and smoked salmon), plus pastries aplenty, wholesome bowls (yogurt with muesli and peaches or acai with raw coconut and goji berries) and specialties like asparagus and fontina omelettes, ham and hashbrown Benedict, black truffle scrambled eggs and shirred eggs Florentine. Come weekend brunch, the breakfast lineup is adjoined by a series of lunch-y items, like Brussels sprouts leaves salad with mustard vinaigrette and Medjool dates, Yang’s Imperial lobster toast with caviar and beef Wellington with mushroom bordelaise.

Alex has been working non-stop upping the ante with each passing season, and most recently was rewarded by the bib in maintaining the two star rating of afforded to Abela’s crowning glory since Bignon first won it in 2013.

Alongside Claude Bosi and Brett Graham, IMHO, these are the three guys currently sitting at the very apex of London gastronomy. That is, if the guide awarded their stars based purely on the performance of the kitchen in that snapshot in time.

His cuisine is one of modernity, subtlety and clarity. Decidedly French with flourishes of Asian influence in a non-intrusive way (quite unlike say Barbot’s love of citrus-charged flavours), his lightness of touch across the dishes is inspired stuff and I find it extremely appealing.

In the evening, there is the epic 8 course which can be had for 320euroes. I went for the 6 courses plus the white truffle supplement (60euroes), and arranged a little wine flight comprised of Haut Brion’s 2nd wines and their non first growth labels.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/11/29/le-clarence-paris/comment-page-1/|Every course here is delivered as sequential multi-plates a la Gagnaire, and as a surprise. In some regard, the spontaneity of Pele’s creative cuisine feels much like a grand version of Parisian bistronomy, played out in a most opulent setting. I think it is every bit worthy of its two star rating and I would compare Pele’s idea of a carte blanche to that of Passage 53. Both Chefs’ frame their menus around a string of balanced and light dishes that flow from the start to finish.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/11/29/le-clarence-paris/comment-page-1/|What really makes Le Clarence rather unique of course are that you can opt for the HM and LMHB first wines – both the whites and the reds – by the glass, and indeed fashion a wine flight based around them. They would still cost a ton, at 130 – 200 euroes a glass, but not thousands if you were to pop the cork on 4 bottles of each of the white and red Graves.

Probably not, as I feel that Pele is still tweaking his ideas about Cantonese flavours in his cuisine. Also, a couple of docked points for presenting tourists with a sub-standard white truffle that is at the moment (mid Nov 2019) showing very well near its peak season. However as it stands, his cuisine is very attractive, the cuisson is generally spot-on and I would love to revisit to see how he is progressing in due time.

Flourished with capucine flower, anchovy, tarvido radicchio that’s been gently rolled on the plancha, softening its mild bitterness , and an exceptional squid ink sauce that has lovely sweet-vinegar gastrique contrasting with the bitter-sweet of the endive and the fish’s umami. A dish that seems so simple, but with everything so measured and so carefully cooked, it was dancing on the palate.

While the seabass was superb, I actually enjoyed the second serving more.

This was followed by a warm finish of classic beef and oysters.

The great chef is of course Anne-Sophie Pic, she inherits a gastronomic dynasty so to speak with a long standing association with the bib, that stretches all the way to when they first revised (and introduced) their multi star rating system.

She received the coveted 3 stars in her own right in 2007. She also owns another eponymous restaurant in Lausanne which currently holds 2 stars. No small feat considering there are not many female chefs in pro kitchens, let alone ones who have reached the pinnacle of their profession. We do have Clare Smyth over here, who will hopefully open her own doors, in the Summer. Much in the spirit of the great Eugenie Brazier and Marie Bourgeois.

I note that they do Latour BTG, on this visit, 2004 at £185 for 125ml. This translates to a bottle price of £1110, which would be at least the 3x mark-up (to be optimistic). Bottom line is one thing, but value for money (compared to market price) is another, but I think this is a little too much for a relatively young Latour and especially considering the private club in the hotel is organised around the first growth, I expect more of a deal. For that money, at least a 2000 perhaps. The wine list (and the Latour discovery room) is looked after by somm Jan Konetzki, who has joined from Gordon Ramsay RHR.

For those who bang on about quality produce, this is one such specimen. In fact outside of Hedone and Bonhams, I don’t know if any other London restaurant offers Live abalone. I hope you guys eat more of it, so more chefs over here will offer it. They’re not as glamorous as Ise or Australian, but Irish and Breton abalones are pretty decent, in the right hands.

Inside the puff, is a jasmine jelly, served ice cold, it is more like a sorbet layer. In its entirety, there are textural, flavour and temperature gradients throughout. The milk foam is subtly infused with pepper, emphasis on the subtle, and works well as a ‘finish’ on the palate. A little interesting that this pepper (Voatsiperifery) is from Madagascar, and yet Pic has elected not to use Bourbon vanilla. I would have thought that ingredients from the same terroir would have more affinity for one another, but well, maybe not, who knows.

If this is truly a reflection of Pic’s palate, then I would say the Chef has a great one. The cuisine is of course very French, but it is her use of subtle non-traditional flavour pairings that really brighten the recipes. I like that the cuisine is quite compact, allowing main ingredients to taste naturally as they should. There is nothing over the top here and nothing is out of control – which is testament to Luca’s management of the team.

I would liken this to Les 110 somewhat in ‘conception’ and in terms of the relaxed ambiance. Though the reality is that DdPL is a more ambitious outfit (it is the Four Seasons after all), and this is obviously reflected in the difference in bottom line. Over time, I am keen to see the menu change up and to see more of Pic’s signature dishes pop-up here. It is nearly the summer, might we see soft-shell native Cornish lobsters in Pic’s red fruit dashi perhaps? It would fit in quite well with what DdPL is about, I think.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2010/03/05/my-experience-with-taiwanese-cuisine/comment-page-1/|Hello folks, I am officially back from my month long vacation, trust you have applied yourselves positively while I’ve been away. My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year. I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff. Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold. Bling. I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent. I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money. I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine. It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours. Something as common as say pizza for example – I can’t say I’ve actually tried a Neapolitan recipe passed down from the ages. This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against. And so Kang’s quest to catch a glimpse into the world of Taiwanese cuisine was born. Here are his notes (So weird writing in the third person).

The capital of the island republic, it is situated on the Northern tip of the country and its name unsurprisingly translates to ‘Northern Taiwan’. Home to 2.6 million, it is an emerging ultra modern metropolis of Blade Runner style concrete jungle and it’s skyline proudly accomodates Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world. Like all cities, there are shades of vintage buildings still lingering underneath all the shiny metal and glass. Old shop houses prop up the neon signs, lighting up the city’s night like a Christmas tree. It’s wonderfully urban, tight street corners just wide enough for cars to pass through and temperamental rainclouds which make London feel like Cyprus. In the belly of the beast lies a diverse range of restaurant, cafés and their famed night markets which play host to hundreds of independent street food vendors making it a sort of foodie’s wet dream. In fact, there is so much diversity in it’s food, a week is simply not enough time to try everything. But I tried anyway. My excursion wouldn’t be as impactful if not for my extended family taking me around the city, so I have the C and C’s to thank for all the recs.

The soup was made with szechuan pepper and as I alluded to earlier, doesn’t just burn your tongue and throat, it actually conjures up a strange numbing sensation that firstly starts on the back of your tongue, and if you’re greedy, works it’s way into the back of your throat.

Like all umami infused food – this bowl of rice smelled hearty, rustic and fragrant. Served piping hot, the large flap of chop garnished with bean braised tofu and pickled cabbage that carried a vinegary stink. The rice was glutinous, almost sushi rice (but I daren’t claim it) and the savoury flouriness of the pork chop was unmistakable. There was a thin outer which encapsulated the piece of meat, eggs must have been used and the coating absorbed alot of moisture leading to a juiciness which softened the texture of the pork. The combination of the bean-flavoured tofu, the vinegary pickled cabbage and the soya infused egginess of the porkchop gave way to an exemplary example of umami… I finished two bowls.

The texture is so consistent, it hardly broke and is akin to the density of say a pannacota. Flavoured with a sweetened soya sauce, the purity of the tofu melds well with the mushy liverness of the preserved duck eggs. The strength of this dish – in my opinion – is dependent on the quality of the tofu. The real deal, everything in London is a mere imitation.

Did you try any zen bing on your trip?  [My pinyin is haphazard – zen bing are those ‘chinese burritos’ that you can get at street markets in Taipei.]

You come out of the MRT station Dingxi (MRT Orange Line) , I think it’s exit number 1, up the escalator, its on the left hand side and you will see the place ‘through the window’ as you are going up the escalator…. more confusing that it sounds, but trust me it should make more sense when you guys get there, basically it’s in a separate building just outside the station 🙂 Ahh… when you are in DingXi make sure try THE original soya milk shop called ‘Dou Jiang Da Wang’. The directions… are difficult to describe, but it’s a five minute walk from the station (Dingxi) and any local in the area should know this place, very popular… ok good luck and hope you enjoy it!!!

I have always thought that the dish originated from the Malayan Straits but perhaps I am mistaken. I mean, it’s essentially poached chicken isn’t it? In fact, I first heard of White Cut Chicken (or ‘bai qie ji’) when a Hongkong colleague mentioned it to me in London. lol.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2010/03/05/my-experience-with-taiwanese-cuisine/comment-page-1/|London Chow – Yeah, essentially the same recipe of poached chicken. I did a bit of research and I think that there are several variations of this recipe, with each cuisine claiming a version of it, and I think there are a few twists and touches with each version. I know for a fact that Bai Zhan Chicken is part and parcel of Hainan cuisine… because my grandfather is from Hainan and he passed down a family recipe to my aunts and uncles (my grandfather is a chef, my dad doesnt cook). In Taiwan, I believe the recipe came from parts of southern China, probably in a similar fashion as Niu Rou Mien.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2010/03/05/my-experience-with-taiwanese-cuisine/comment-page-1/|Oh not fluffy, etc.  Zen bing really is like a burrito.  You get a flour pancake (almost like a flour tortilla, but a bit tougher – hot off the griddle), and it’s filled with a little rice, veg, egg, chinese sausage – whatever you like, really.  The best part, in my opinion, was always the crushed peanuts/peanut powder to add crunch and sweet nuttiness.  It’s great stuff and I’d recommend looking out for it next time you’re in Tapiei.  [I used to spend summers in Taipei when I was little.]

Spontaneity and creativity reign supreme, Passard and his kitchen still immensely spirited in their practice of gastronomy at the highest levels, they continue to introduce new dishes to their menu, not bad for a restaurant now in its 33rd year. As usual, Tony Beldroega was in charge of the affairs today, with the Chef himself making an appearance mid-way through lunch to greet punters. I had wanted to try Alain’s latest Frankenstein creation, the Chimera, pigeon stiched together with a rack of lamb, but alas it wasn’t on the menu on this visit.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|For this meal, I decided to try the Gardener’s lunch again, now 175€ ,  supplemented with a half portion of the lobster/vin jaune (now 210€ for the whole, 105€ for the half) and also asked kindly if I could try their vegetable tatin as well as their strawberries, now in its prime.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|As you might be familiar, the lunch menu is essentially themed around whatever vegetables they have in abundance from Alain’s two gardens. They tend to repeat themselves over the course of the longish meal. In the case of this meal, yellow round courgettes and white asparagus appeared to be at peak. If you arrive at the restaurant around 11ish, you’ll see the little white van delivering their daily haul of greens.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|I feel that April/May is the best time to visit L’Arpege, especially if you are interested in vegetables. All the colours are in full bloom, lobster and turbot are near their peaks, peas are sweet and strawberries are ripe and ready. Cigalines instead of mara de bois or gariguttes this year.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|L’Arpege is a restaurant that continues to enthrall me, the cuisine is very much based on improvisation and it is very rustic and homely in many ways, the antithesis of rehearsed, static crafted tasting menus. The food here is fine in its eating, while the dishes are beautiful to look at, the kitchen spends the majority cooking rather than plating little things perfectly. Some people do not like it for this very reason, but I love L’Arpege because at the heart of it all, the restaurant is about pure cooking, slow grilled proteins cooked grand and whole, and daring la minute preparations for everything else. It might seem counter intuitive to say this, but in today’s world of foraged, water bath modernism, L’Arpege is in the minority when it comes to actually delivering hot food on piping hot plates. A pre-requisite as it always should be for any fine food that is cooked with love and respect!
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|When you visit, it really is worth spending some time to study all their menus deeply, and then to make sure you speak up and ask for anything you want to try. They can mix and match anything on their menus, and also stuff that’s not on their menus. I cannot stress this enough, if you simply leave it up to them, chances are you will almost definitely be disappointed and wonder what the fuss is all about. These guys love a challenge believe me, the more bespoke your menu is, the better the meal becomes. It’s going to  cost an arm and leg regardless of what you do, so if you’ve made up your mind to go here, then do like Magnus Nilsson when he left L’Astrance and do it in style.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|I drank a most interesting wine, 2017 Les Vignes de Paradis Terroir du Léman Un Matin Face au Lac, which is made from 100% Chasselas, a grape that I don’t believe I’ve ever come across. I wrote down chalky mango and peach on the nose, more of that on the palate, with oiliness to it. Superb wine.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|Today with a consomme of asparagus, mint and thyme. One of Alain’s classics, and one of my all time favourites from his oeuvre of vegetable cooking.

It is very lightly seasoned, it doesn’t even have much in way of oil, a very sensitive and pure dish showcasing the natural flavour in which the Grand Cru vegetables from Alain’s gardens possess. This is what I love about L’Arpege.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|I greatly enjoyed this meaty pate, loosely packed with the savouriness of duck fat and perfectly seasoned.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|Passard’s grand cru vegetables from his gardens meeting his kitchen’s three starred calibre craft. This was incredible – roasted and fully imbued with smokey, charred flavours, the courgette itself of prime quality. Meanwhile the flower was stuffed with a medley of superior savouriness, cooked down vegetables, onions, garlic, other things which my limited palate could hardly identify. The sauce had deep flavour itself, backed up by luxurious and low density frothed creaminess and acidity, acting as a counterpoint to the roasted courgette.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|The layering of flavours fan out to cover all four tastes simultaneously leading to a wide gamut umami that had me scratching my head as to how they manage so much flavour extraction from purely just vegetables. Genius dish, with its composition guided by the saturation of nature’s primary colours. Exactly the sort of dish that only L’Arpege is capable of producing.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|I don’t have much love for this dish, as in the past I find the sweet and sour honey sauce both overly sweet and too acidic at the very same time. On this occasion however, the sauce is reigned in, the sweet and acid gentle as opposed to a punch in the face. Now I could taste the dance of sweetness between the ocean of the lobster and the earth of the translucent globe turnip slices. The lobster this time round was cooked a pointe – just a touch mi-cuit. This is a lovely dish when they get it right for sure.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|Decidedly simple, homely in appearance, adorned with chive flowers, though as we are at L’Arpege, the craft involved is a world class marvel. It came piping hot, and no doubt cooked la minute as the pastry was still warm on arrival.

An inspired pairing, so simple, so perfectly seasoned and so utterly delicious.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|Of course the secret here is their supremely fine puff pastry, so delicate in its flakiness, that it gifts the tatin a soft and smooth texture, collapsing like a hot knife through butter with the gentlest push. An embodiment of the genius comfort food and the exquisite craft of L’Arpege.

Quartered lengthwise, each “aiguillette” position plated facing opposite directions with tail, tomalley and claw on the plate. This dish is always served on a heavy plate that is piping hot, including the sauce taken to the highest temperature, frothed up to a lightened texture.

The vin jaune sauce, like all sauces at L’Arpège, is simply the finest. The gastrique is perfect, the salt and acidity, the oxidative nuttiness of the wine, all these elements pulling and pushing to create harmony and tension with the lobster flesh and tomalley. Put simply, I have not tasted a better sauce than this. Today Tony has blended in some coral, yielding a light orange pigment, and adding layer of ocean sweetness to the sauce.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|The Chausey island lobster – tied rostrum to tail to keep the tail straight during its boil– is usually timed to mi-cuit, however on this visit, the tail was quite firm (firmer than the lobster/turnip served a few courses earlier), and to my taste a touch over, by a minute perhaps. This was a pretty big lobster, looks 1kg mark. It’s massive claw and knuckle on the other hand came out just right. Saying this, the bounce on the meat was a sign of a healthy crustacean and didn’t detract from the overall experience. I feel very fortunate to have had this a few times, I am perpetually in awe of it. A dish of timeless magnificence.

It evoked childhood memories of cream and honey, sugary sweets and honeyed ice cream. I loved it.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|For me, this remains the gold standard of puff pastry. Incredible fine and delicate flakes. The chocolate is very pure, you can taste the bitterness and it comes without too much sweetness. Personally, I prefer the vanilla MF over this one, but the all-chocolate puff pastry is definitely something to admire. Class.

These aren’t as fragrant as the gariguettes, rather balanced in flavour but quite juicy. I wouldn’t say they are better than Mare des Bois either.

I thought blue lobster from ‘Brittany’ area is available all year long (e.g. you always find a lobster dish at L’Ambroisie)
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/05/23/larpege-paris-may-2019/comment-page-1/|They are technically not seasonal and are indeed avaiable all year round. But Lobsters in the English Channel between Dorset and Brittany are at their best around the summer, starting from say June and run till August. July is probably the most plentiful month, and prices are cheapest. I did have the lobster vin jaune in November last year.

I am led to believe that in addition to counting the feasible beans…there are also ‘magic numbers’ which Wikio uses in their algorithms to determine the rankings.

Last year, this place was taken over by the genius team of mark fuller and andy taylor with gary hollihead applying his michelin starred skills in the kitchen. Geales is about a 5 minute walk from notting hill gate tube and is conveniently tucked away behind the cinema.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2008/09/07/review-geales-posh-fish-and-chips/|are attempting a similar thing. You can even find an excellent example at belgo’s in covent garden. Though, I think the main difference at geales is that fish and chips takes centre stage. This hardworking dish has seemingly been given a slick makeover, abit like how a nostalgic tv show gets the silver screen treatment. Think charlie’s angels, erm, mission impossible? Another great chef, Tom Aikens of chelsea attempted it in similar fashion at tom’s place, it would have been nice to try it, but sadly, the neighbours very recently brought about a shock closure.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2008/09/07/review-geales-posh-fish-and-chips/|I believe the secret to getting really good chips is to double fry them, so they are crispy on the outside and use top quality spuds like maris piper to make them soft and fluffy on the inside. Just look at the chips, they are an absolute beauty and they taste great. But there’s the issue of price, that’s a double portion that costs £6. Its abit steep, granted they do taste good, but is it justifiable paying a £5 premium to get chips that taste marginally better than burger king?
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2008/09/07/review-geales-posh-fish-and-chips/|Im no expert on mushy peas, but again its a double portion that costs £6…except this not very good. It was lumpy and rather bland; my canteen at work (yes, i have a real job) does this for free with the friday ‘fish of the day’ option. And that taste alot better than what geales had to offer.

Where was the gushing steam? I found a measly portion, covered by a thick batter with large pockets of air. Gaps so large, I suspect the chef blew air in through a tiny hole while he was frying the fish. At first i questioned the seasalt, but my first bite confirmed my fears, the fish was bland. It really needed the salt.

According to some of the critics, they say that because it wasnt fried in beef tallow, it’s not going to be great. Well, they were right. I was expecting the fish to be moist but it was a tad on the soggy side for me. I was sorely disappointed because it just looked so good. Im trying to convince myself that maybe mine was just a rare slip up and the next time I return it’ll be a much improved.

Bottom line is one thing, but value for money (compared to market price) is another, but I think this is a little too much for a relatively young Latour and especially considering the private club in the hotel is organised around the first growth, I expect more of a deal. For that money, at least a 2000 perhaps. The wine list (and the Latour discovery room) is looked after by somm Jan Konetzki, who has joined from Gordon Ramsay RHR.

For those who bang on about quality produce, this is one such specimen. In fact outside of Hedone and Bonhams, I don’t know if any other London restaurant offers Live abalone. I hope you guys eat more of it, so more chefs over here will offer it. They’re not as glamorous as Ise or Australian, but Irish and Breton abalones are pretty decent, in the right hands.

Inside the puff, is a jasmine jelly, served ice cold, it is more like a sorbet layer. In its entirety, there are textural, flavour and temperature gradients throughout. The milk foam is subtly infused with pepper, emphasis on the subtle, and works well as a ‘finish’ on the palate. A little interesting that this pepper (Voatsiperifery) is from Madagascar, and yet Pic has elected not to use Bourbon vanilla. I would have thought that ingredients from the same terroir would have more affinity for one another, but well, maybe not, who knows.

If this is truly a reflection of Pic’s palate, then I would say the Chef has a great one. The cuisine is of course very French, but it is her use of subtle non-traditional flavour pairings that really brighten the recipes. I like that the cuisine is quite compact, allowing main ingredients to taste naturally as they should. There is nothing over the top here and nothing is out of control – which is testament to Luca’s management of the team.

I would liken this to Les 110 somewhat in ‘conception’ and in terms of the relaxed ambiance. Though the reality is that DdPL is a more ambitious outfit (it is the Four Seasons after all), and this is obviously reflected in the difference in bottom line. Over time, I am keen to see the menu change up and to see more of Pic’s signature dishes pop-up here. It is nearly the summer, might we see soft-shell native Cornish lobsters in Pic’s red fruit dashi perhaps? It would fit in quite well with what DdPL is about, I think.

My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year. I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff. Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold. Bling. I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent. I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money. I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine. It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours. Something as common as say pizza for example – I can’t say I’ve actually tried a Neapolitan recipe passed down from the ages. This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against. And so Kang’s quest to catch a glimpse into the world of Taiwanese cuisine was born. Here are his notes (So weird writing in the third person).

The capital of the island republic, it is situated on the Northern tip of the country and its name unsurprisingly translates to ‘Northern Taiwan’. Home to 2.6 million, it is an emerging ultra modern metropolis of Blade Runner style concrete jungle and it’s skyline proudly accomodates Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world. Like all cities, there are shades of vintage buildings still lingering underneath all the shiny metal and glass. Old shop houses prop up the neon signs, lighting up the city’s night like a Christmas tree. It’s wonderfully urban, tight street corners just wide enough for cars to pass through and temperamental rainclouds which make London feel like Cyprus. In the belly of the beast lies a diverse range of restaurant, cafés and their famed night markets which play host to hundreds of independent street food vendors making it a sort of foodie’s wet dream. In fact, there is so much diversity in it’s food, a week is simply not enough time to try everything. But I tried anyway. My excursion wouldn’t be as impactful if not for my extended family taking me around the city, so I have the C and C’s to thank for all the recs.

The rice was glutinous, almost sushi rice (but I daren’t claim it) and the savoury flouriness of the pork chop was unmistakable. There was a thin outer which encapsulated the piece of meat, eggs must have been used and the coating absorbed alot of moisture leading to a juiciness which softened the texture of the pork. The combination of the bean-flavoured tofu, the vinegary pickled cabbage and the soya infused egginess of the porkchop gave way to an exemplary example of umami… I finished two bowls.

The strength of this dish – in my opinion – is dependent on the quality of the tofu. The real deal, everything in London is a mere imitation.

You come out of the MRT station Dingxi (MRT Orange Line) , I think it’s exit number 1, up the escalator, its on the left hand side and you will see the place ‘through the window’ as you are going up the escalator…. more confusing that it sounds, but trust me it should make more sense when you guys get there, basically it’s in a separate building just outside the station 🙂 Ahh… when you are in DingXi make sure try THE original soya milk shop called ‘Dou Jiang Da Wang’. The directions… are difficult to describe, but it’s a five minute walk from the station (Dingxi) and any local in the area should know this place, very popular… ok good luck and hope you enjoy it!!!

I did a bit of research and I think that there are several variations of this recipe, with each cuisine claiming a version of it, and I think there are a few twists and touches with each version. I know for a fact that Bai Zhan Chicken is part and parcel of Hainan cuisine… because my grandfather is from Hainan and he passed down a family recipe to my aunts and uncles (my grandfather is a chef, my dad doesnt cook). In Taiwan, I believe the recipe came from parts of southern China, probably in a similar fashion as Niu Rou Mien.

You get a flour pancake (almost like a flour tortilla, but a bit tougher – hot off the griddle), and it’s filled with a little rice, veg, egg, chinese sausage – whatever you like, really.  The best part, in my opinion, was always the crushed peanuts/peanut powder to add crunch and sweet nuttiness.  It’s great stuff and I’d recommend looking out for it next time you’re in Tapiei.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2010/03/05/my-experience-with-taiwanese-cuisine/?replytocom=40967|Hello folks, I am officially back from my month long vacation, trust you have applied yourselves positively while I’ve been away. My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year. I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff. Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold. Bling. I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent. I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money. I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine. It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours. Something as common as say pizza for example – I can’t say I’ve actually tried a Neapolitan recipe passed down from the ages. This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against. And so Kang’s quest to catch a glimpse into the world of Taiwanese cuisine was born. Here are his notes (So weird writing in the third person).
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2010/03/05/my-experience-with-taiwanese-cuisine/?replytocom=40967|The scene is Taipei. The capital of the island republic, it is situated on the Northern tip of the country and its name unsurprisingly translates to ‘Northern Taiwan’. Home to 2.6 million, it is an emerging ultra modern metropolis of Blade Runner style concrete jungle and it’s skyline proudly accomodates Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world. Like all cities, there are shades of vintage buildings still lingering underneath all the shiny metal and glass. Old shop houses prop up the neon signs, lighting up the city’s night like a Christmas tree. It’s wonderfully urban, tight street corners just wide enough for cars to pass through and temperamental rainclouds which make London feel like Cyprus. In the belly of the beast lies a diverse range of restaurant, cafés and their famed night markets which play host to hundreds of independent street food vendors making it a sort of foodie’s wet dream. In fact, there is so much diversity in it’s food, a week is simply not enough time to try everything. But I tried anyway. My excursion wouldn’t be as impactful if not for my extended family taking me around the city, so I have the C and C’s to thank for all the recs.

The brew is light and carries a chrysanthemum sweetness about it – very easy drinking stuff. We started with a selection of ‘small dishes’ to share dishes and to start – something which is characteristic of a Taiwanese meal – including Kousiu (Saliva) chicken , Quaiwei (weird taste) vermicelli, Dou gan zhe (bean curd slices) and Mala tripe. As it was a Szechuan restaurant, everything was red in colour, evident of potent sliced chilli everywhere and the tranquilising effect of Szechuan pepper slowly started to grab hold of my tastebuds. Terrifying.

The soup was made with szechuan pepper and as I alluded to earlier, doesn’t just burn your tongue and throat, it actually conjures up a strange numbing sensation that firstly starts on the back of your tongue, and if you’re greedy, works it’s way into the back of your throat. I downed several glasses of gold medal beer to put the fire out. Eventually, I couldn’t feel my tastebuds anymore. If you head to Angelis in Kilburn or

It’s usually protocol to have a layer of oil floating on top of the soup, it’s suppose to keep the heat in and also to cook whatever you’ve dunked into the soup. I am certain that London restaurants hold back on the peppers – this place didn’t.

The town is a scenic getaway from the high tech city of Taipei.

Restaurants lined the coast, and as we went on a Sunday, it was as if all of Taipei had descended upon this area. We had trekked all the way here to visit the Black Shop, and to sample the locally celebrated pork chop rice.

Small, unassuming and humble. There would be nothing high brow about it, but again the attraction was apparent in it’s unpretension, just so real.

The soup was oily, but filled with meaty and stocky flavours – very homely. Like most of the soupy meats I had sampled in Taipei, the spare ribs melted like ice cream.

This dish stank of bamboo shoots and vinegar, the tripe added to the soured livery flavours of this dish. It was a difficult mouthful for me, not my cup of tea this one, but about as Taiwanese as it could get.

You come out of the MRT station Dingxi (MRT Orange Line) , I think it’s exit number 1, up the escalator, its on the left hand side and you will see the place ‘through the window’ as you are going up the escalator…. more confusing that it sounds, but trust me it should make more sense when you guys get there, basically it’s in a separate building just outside the station 🙂 Ahh… when you are in DingXi make sure try THE original soya milk shop called ‘Dou Jiang Da Wang’. The directions… are difficult to describe, but it’s a five minute walk from the station (Dingxi) and any local in the area should know this place, very popular… ok good luck and hope you enjoy it!!!

I have always thought that the dish originated from the Malayan Straits but perhaps I am mistaken. I mean, it’s essentially poached chicken isn’t it? In fact, I first heard of White Cut Chicken (or ‘bai qie ji’) when a Hongkong colleague mentioned it to me in London. lol.

I did a bit of research and I think that there are several variations of this recipe, with each cuisine claiming a version of it, and I think there are a few twists and touches with each version. I know for a fact that Bai Zhan Chicken is part and parcel of Hainan cuisine… because my grandfather is from Hainan and he passed down a family recipe to my aunts and uncles (my grandfather is a chef, my dad doesnt cook). In Taiwan, I believe the recipe came from parts of southern China, probably in a similar fashion as Niu Rou Mien.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2010/03/05/my-experience-with-taiwanese-cuisine/?replytocom=40967|Oh not fluffy, etc.  Zen bing really is like a burrito.  You get a flour pancake (almost like a flour tortilla, but a bit tougher – hot off the griddle), and it’s filled with a little rice, veg, egg, chinese sausage – whatever you like, really.  The best part, in my opinion, was always the crushed peanuts/peanut powder to add crunch and sweet nuttiness.  It’s great stuff and I’d recommend looking out for it next time you’re in Tapiei.  [I used to spend summers in Taipei when I was little.]

I am led to believe that in addition to counting the feasible beans…there are also ‘magic numbers’ which Wikio uses in their algorithms to determine the rankings. Although to be fair, all ranking methods are abit wonky anyway as they can vary widely depending on which they view carries more/less weight. Like for example Compete.com , Alexa and even Google’s own PageRank algorithms all vary differently.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-06-2007/geales-w8/|This prettily-located chippy now loudly proclaims the formerly little-known fact that it was established in 1939. It is only very recently, however –  since its acquisition by the Embassy (Mayfair nightclub) people – that it has got in touch with its heritage side.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-06-2007/geales-w8/|The battered former appearance of the place (ho ho) has now been swept away, and it boasts décor in a whole sample-card of shades of grey. The impression this gives is undeniably chic, even if it owes more to New England than to Kensington.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-06-2007/geales-w8/|The food struck us as similarly displaced: plucked from its roots, it just didn’t quite feel right. Take, for example, the humble prawn cocktail: a known and usual dish if ever there was one. But this one wasn’t: it was a prawn-and-avocado cocktail. It was yellow rather than pink. And it came in an oddly-shaped vessel that tipped. nodding-donkey-style, when each spoonful was taken. None of these developments was an advance on tradition.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-06-2007/geales-w8/|There is also the size issue. This is the first fish ‘n’ chip shop we’ve ever left feeling hungry, such was the enthusiasm for portion-control. This extended not only to the main dishes, but also to the accompaniments. (Some of these, however, such as the crispy onion rings, were very good.) The choice of puds was not inspiring, so we chose ice cream, which was fine.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-06-2007/geales-w8/|As we left from our early supper, there was already a steady flow of vaguely fashionable diners arriving, most of whom – perhaps inspired by favourable reviews elsewhere – had clearly booked.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|Hidden away in Hammersmith, a newcomer seeking to evoke memories of the legendary early-’90s restaurant on the site; it was good-all-round on our early-days visit, but the standards which would once have been exceptional are now relatively commonplace.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|Hammersmith estate agents have a lot to thank this site for. Over twenty years ago, the founding of a cute little restaurant there helped to rebrand a tangle of Victorian backstreets as ‘Brackenbury Village’, and their commissions have benefitted ever since.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|In those far off days, it really was quite the destination: at the vanguard of the ‘Modern British’ revolution. It promised what, for its time, was groundbreaking, affordable-quality cooking – a reward for those who braved this then-offbeat slice of Zone 2 (a destination in those days not even needed for ‘The Knowledge’).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|The site has had its ups and downs and after a short stint in recent times as ‘The Port of Manilla’ – a magnet for Filippinos everywhere, but out-of-step with its natural local clientele – it’s been returned to its former guise by a local resident who also happens to be restaurant royalty: Ossie Gray’s mother Rose co-founded the River Café.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|Sunday lunch with the family, all warmly welcomed, provided the opportunity for an inaugural visit under this nicely casual new regime.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|The menu is sensibly short, offering enough to interest visitors, but approachable enough for locals who can’t be bothered to cook too.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|There was quite a fork fight for the starters. Perhaps the most contested was the fritto misto of salt cod and radicchio, with aioli. The grown-ups, though, favoured the bruschetta of braised cima di rape (a variant of broccoli), with ricotta, spiced olives and (uncompromising) grilled chilli. Main dishes, such as rabbit leg braised in mustard, garlic and white wine with roseval potatoes and spinach was just the meal for a miserable day. Better perhaps was the grilled black bream, fennel, orange and olive salad.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|Prices are reasonable but – given the decidedly ‘local’ setting – we couldn’t help wondering if it wouldn’t make sense to offer some special menus for brunch, early evening and so on. Will people from outside the ‘Village’ seek the place out? We hope so, but if you’re planning a special visit, wait for warmer weather – the large pavement terrace is a particular attraction.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|On the eastern fringe of Covent Garden, a smart basement Japanese restaurant with a rather corporate atmosphere and quite high prices (especially on the wine front); for business entertainment, though, it has its attractions, and the lunch menu is a value-proposition well worth seeking out.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|Notably friendly staff are one of the attractions of this smart new basement Japanese, on the ‘wrong’ (Eastern) side of Kingsway. They still seemed a touch startled, though, when the ace Harden’s inspection team (in this case, a solitary luncher) walked in. ‘Are you from the hotel’, the desk man enquired, kindly, trying to make sense of it all.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|It rather seems, then, that this is a restaurant which is not – yet – accustomed to much lunchtime walk-in business. That’s a shame, as the lunch menu here is well worth seeking out. We went for the Bento Lunch (£17.50), which – in the range and quality of the dishes – is one of the most ambitious we can recall (excluding the ridiculous Hakkasan-group newcomer Crystan, of course, but that’s another story altogether). The box comprised a range of sushi, and of sashimi, and some cooked fish, as well as a very tasty chicken pancake-sandwich and a bowl of miso soup. If that doesn’t sound very filling, it wasn’t, but the attention to detail, the tastes and the textures were impressive throughout.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|Fortunately, then, the Bento box left ample space for a pudding – on the evidence of the elegantly plated assembly of salted caramel ice-cream, pancake and chestnut we enjoyed, these are well worth leaving space for. The waitress even prompted us to have a coffee – she promised, in the face of all the precedents of Japanese restaurants, that it would be good’ and our espresso was indeed surprisingly impressive.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|That coffee was, however, also £3, hinting at one key reservation about this place which is that, Ã  la carte, the prices seem rather high. In fact, drinking water here – tap was willingly brought – seems a good idea all-round, as even quite modest clarets, for example, quickly whizz past the £50 mark. The other major drawback is that, though the setting is comfortable enough, the rather rectilinear layout of this decidedly rectangular basement makes for a setting whose atmosphere tips inescapably towards the corporate.

We assume, however, that this offshoot of the S&P group is a a prototype for a new ‘diffusion’ multiple to be situated mainly, perhaps exclusively, in upmarket shopping malls – it has that pleasant-enough-but-somehow-no-real-character feeling which seems to be aim of all those who design eating places in or near shopping centres.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|We all know restaurant groups have DNA – resemblances between the members of the ‘family’ explicable by their common origins. A pretty good example is the ‘Nigel Platts-Martin group’.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|If you live outside restaurant-land, you may never have heard of this former City solicitor, but he’s just pulled off the remarkable double of being a major stakeholder not only in Chez Bruce (perennially London’s Favourite Restaurant, as determined by Harden’s reporters), but also in the restaurant newly-crowned as the one where you get London’s best food, The Ledbury.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|The subject of this review, Medlar is, so far as we know, the first break-away from the P-M empire. The chef Joe Mercer Nairne is ex-Chez Bruce, and the manager, David O’Connor, formerly held the same position at its Mayfair outpost, The Square.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|On the evidence of Medlar, it seems that restaurant DNA can be acquired – unlike the real sort – simply by propinquity and experience. How else to explain that the new Chelsea restaurant feels, for all practical purposes, just as if Mr Platts-Martin had a share in it? (He definitely doesn’t.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|Or, rather, it feels as if the early-days Mr Platts-Martin has a share in it, having that slightly ‘never knowingly undersold’ feeling Chez Bruce used to have, before it got quite famous, a little bit grand, and quite a lot more spacious and comfortable.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|Ay, there’s the rub. Medlar – as is quite natural for restaurateurs in their early independent days – has that slightly cramped, slightly cramped, slightly ‘there-are-no-good-tables’ feel Chez Bruce had in the early days.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|That’s the bad news. The good news is that all the other bits of the DNA have come too, so the menu is full of nice food with a gentle twist, so that you feel you want to eat all the way through it. When the dishes come, you’re not disappointed by the results. And the service, by and large, manages to be there when you want it, and mercifully absent when you don’t. And a very good wine list too.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|In short, you might say, Medlar has many of the qualities you might associate with the legendary ‘perfect neighbourhood restaurant’.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|Which begs a very interesting question. When was the last time Chelsea had a real reputation as a good mid-market restaurant neighbourhood? If anything, the King’s Road has a bit of a name as the-street-with-no-restaurants. It wasn’t always so, of course. Not that we were there, you understand, but wasn’t there quite a scene there in the ’60s? That momentum carried on into the ’80s (when we do sort of remember it).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|By the ’90s, however, the spotlight had begin to move ‘Up West’, and – with the odd exception in the environs of Sloane Square – not much has been heard from Chelsea ever since. The area may be full of people who are as rich as Croesus, nowadays, but they do seem rather to have stultified the restaurant scene.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|But we digress. Will Medlar work? We hope it will, but – times having moved on since the ’60s, and even the early days of Chez Bruce, the ’90s – we must admit we didn’t particularly enjoy eating food of this undoubted quality in surroundings we found slightly uncongenial.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-05-2011/riding-house-cafe-w1/|Our first surprise on visiting this attractive-looking newcomer, was that, despite the name, it’s as proper a brasserie as you’ll find – a sort of younger and trendier Wolseley. What good news! Despite being ‘twinned’, via the Eurostar, with the greatest ‘brasserie city’ in the world, London still has few good examples of the breed, and we lag New York in that respect too. Spiritually, the newcomer is the real thing.

Beyond the basic concept –  all-day options, slightly wacky style, flexibility of menu, variety of dining areas, and so on – there’s nothing obviously Gallic about the formula. And the third? Pace Observer columnist Jay Rayner’s recent views on the subject, New York is clearly the style beacon du jour for many of London’s restaurateurs, yet this place manages to avoid many of those Big Apple-style decorative flourishes which are fast becoming clichés.

Indeed, we even found the modesty of some of the portions being explicitly used as a sales tool – ‘you may find you’ll want some vegetables with that main course! – and continual staff efforts to ‘up-sell’ became something of a leitmotif of our meal.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-04-2010/tsuru-ec2/|It’s almost impossible to overstate the change that’s come over the City in the past quarter-century. How did those of us who worked there in those far-off days survive with hardly any shopping and hardly anywhere to eat?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-04-2010/tsuru-ec2/|Nowadays, of course, the City is full of shiny new ‘developments’; you can’t have a development without ‘retail’; and wherever you have retail nowadays, the money men say you have to have ‘grazing’ too.

In the old days, for example, you’d never have found the landlord of a big City office building willing, as here, to lease out space to a small, independent operator such as Tsuru, which has just one existing outlet on the South Bank.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-04-2010/tsuru-ec2/|The new operation nods to both Big Money and small entrepreneurship. On the one hand, the setting is as Manhattanite as you’ll find in London – indeed, the semi-al fresco tables are as urban as anything in town. On the other hand, however, there’s a human feel to the service and the presentation of the cuisine which is rather endearing.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-04-2010/tsuru-ec2/|We enjoyed both our sushi – presented as a more home-made version in the style you find at Pret – and our scallop curry with copious rice. Presumably the latter’s presentation, a symphony in brown, was authentic. Overall, however, it is the personable style of the operation and the reasonable prices, which – if we worked locally – would be likely to draw us back.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|Chancery Lane, the high street of the London legal world, was until very recently, maintaining the English high street tradition of not having restaurants of any note. The situation has improved a bit in recent years, with the arrival in the immediate area of Chancery, and also the very wine-led basement bar and restaurant 28-50.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|This essentially English setting has now seen a very Gallic incursion. A restaurant once known by the suitably stolid name of Hodgson’s has now been taken over by the Club Gascon folk, and given a very French name indeed. Cigalon strikes us as an odd choice, though, echoing as it does that of a Marcel Pagnol movie whose eponymous hero was a ProvenÃ§al chef whose restaurant remained defiantly empty. Perhaps the French have a sense of humour after all?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|Further evidence of such humour is the dress of the largely male staff. We don’t normally comment on attire, but the dress here is too ridiculous to pass without comment: a uniform for the chaps that renders bizarrre the idea that France could be the home of chic. Clip-on braces are a sartorial solecism at the best of times. Why make all the (perfectly charming, French) male staff wear them? We felt as if were were extras in sitcom set in a tacky menswear shop.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|And then we progress to the vexed question of décor. The light and bright premises of character (originally the premises of a Georgian auctioneer) have been given a ProvenÃ§al-pastel make-over – as our lunch guest commented, ideal for ladies who lunch. But – hello! – we’re spiritually in the ECs, darling. The ECs are where the husbands of ladies-who-lunch venture out, mainly with other chaps, to keep the ladies-who-lunch in the Ws and SWs with their white wine spritzers. Who’s this décor for? How’s it going to feel in still semi-Dickensian Legal-Town in the deep midwinter? We shudder – almost literally – to think. (And the summer is traditionally a quiet time around the inns of court.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|The food is not bad, but – like the décor – we couldn’t help wondering if it is ‘right’. The bread, a selection, was OK, if not at all remarkable, but the overwhelming impression of a bowl of ProvenÃ§al vegetable soup was that it was rather a lady’s portion. Our guest’s small portion of marinated sardines similarly failed to cause much excitement.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|Main courses were a strikingly bronze-plated dish of red mullet (plus some impressively twiddled-with courgettes), and a relatively substantial veal chop, which our guest ultimately touted as the highlight of the meal. Puddings included a pleasant (if rather could-do-this-at-home) mélange of citrus fruits and sponge, and a very delicate chocolate tart, somewhat peculiarly presented on a slate platter with what looked like a small deboned fish, but which turned out to be a fancy smear of curd. Our guest pronounced it a moderate success, which was also his view of the coffee.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|So what are we to make of a ladies’ restaurant in the heart of legal london, without either the boho appeal of Club Gascon, or the chic of its Sloane Square satellite, Le Cercle?

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/14-08-2012/banca-w1/|Mayfair these days is not for the likes of you and us (NFLYU). Sorry, that’s presumptuous. Perhaps you have a yacht? And a supercar which, in bored moments, you drive up and down South Audley Street? And as to your tax domicile? Well, who’s asking?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/14-08-2012/banca-w1/|This new Italian restaurant is, technically speaking, not really in the NFLYU southern stretch of Audley Street. It’s on the wrong, northern, side of the social and financial chasm which is Grosvenor Square. (In the distance, you can see – horrors! – Oxford Street.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/14-08-2012/banca-w1/|The punters, though, still mostly give the impression of just having stepped off their yachts. (But, hey! This was during the Olympics: perhaps they had.) As Mr and Mrs Ordinary Englishpeople, we did feel a bit out of place. For the most part, though, the staff tried not to make us feel as if we Stood Out Horribly, and mainly succeeded. (The sole exception was one of the maÃ®tre d’ types who – as he took our order – found something much more interesting to concentrate on, on the other side of the room.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/14-08-2012/banca-w1/|The room itself – not actually betraying many traces of the banca it formerly was – has been done out in a comfortable, no-expense-spared sort of way which, entirely like the crowd, looked as if it belonged everywhere-and-nowhere. Unless hanging out with the rich is regarded as an end it itself, this is rather unsatisfying. You’re paying ‘destination’ prices, yet there’s no feeling that you actually arrived anywhere. (Unless of course the establishment comes complete with a human zoo, like C London, say, and this place doesn’t.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/14-08-2012/banca-w1/|It would be satisfying to end by saying the cuisine here is comfort food of the banal type which the international rich seem to like, but that would unfortunately be entirely untrue. Indeed, a starter of peaches and lobster presented on a glass plate was one of the most unexpectedly beautiful and delicious dishes – utterly satisfying in its simplicity of both presentation and taste – that we’ve had for a very long time. The two pasta dishes which we’d ordered (did we mention we felt poor?) were also very commendable. Pasta is often satisfying but rarely interesting – these dishes were both.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/17-07-2014/penkul-banks/|Under unchanged ownership, but new management, the Shoreditch premises once known as Beard-to-Tail still look rather as they did when we reviewed that informal bar-restaurant a year ago, not especially kindly. (Occasionally, we get things right!)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/17-07-2014/penkul-banks/|This is still, it seems, a work-in-progress, and we were, on our visit, told that the woody (and, by night, rather glum-looking) rear dining room of the establishment would not be fully ‘transformed’ till Christmas.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/17-07-2014/penkul-banks/|Some of the important things, though, already seem to be going very much in the right direction: this struck us as a very handy sort of informal all-day restaurant’ even if it still does have a bit of work to do to impress the locals. We lunched pretty much alone. The welcome is warm, and the food – if not especially ambitious – was in a different league from our former visit.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/17-07-2014/penkul-banks/|From the daytime menu – essentially a cut-down selection from the evening offering – we were able to try most of the types of dishes on offer. Tasty tomato bread, for example, made a good complement for a fresh-tasting assemblage of peas, beans and Feta-type cheese, and the brace of mini cheeseburgers were very decent too. Star of the show, though, was the tuna tataki – a nicely balanced small (but quite generous) plate and, in accordance with the fashion du jour, attractively florally enhanced.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/17-07-2014/penkul-banks/|The drinks selection was inviting, and quite reasonably priced too. For lunch, a pint of Brooklyn – what else, round here? – made a very good accompaniment.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/21-11-2007/mango-tree-se1/|A business meeting took us – late in the day, in restaurant-reviewing terms, as it opened in the spring of 2007 – to this Indian restaurant, just round the corner from Borough Market. (Go out the Neal’s Yard Cheeses way.) The menu is fairly standard, but quite long, so we asked the charming waiting staff to choose. They promptly brought us a succession of dishes, all of which – albeit in pretty ‘standard’ style – were very good.

Sourdough with Marmite butter (“as pillowy as Kylie Jenner’s lips… carbohydrate of the gods”) was followed by an “utterly brilliant” meal that was “a masterclass in balance: sweetness and acidity, crunch and emollience”.

It’s essentially a posh food court – “you still queue, order, ship your own drinks and sit open-plan” but anywhere calling itself a “collection of independent kitchens and incubation-focused mezzanine space showcasing emerging culinary concepts” needs to take a long hard look in the mirror.

For nearly half a century, it’s been owned by members of the ‘Spaghetti House’ family, and, in recent years, had traded as Vecchia Milano. After the recent re-launch, Milan is still the theme (‘Brera’ being the name of the oldest part of that city). Now, however, the aim is a sort of discreet, contemporary chic previously foreign to the Spaghetti House group (or, indeed, to the related Getti establishments).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/11-01-2007/brera-w1/|The low-lit interior is intriguing, with a single row of dining tables encircling an attractive, slightly sunken bar. Offering an extensive cocktail list, the bar aims to become a destination in its own right. We see potential tensions here. The Miami Beach hotel-lobby music playing the lunchtime we visited, for example, was rather at odds with a restaurant menu whose prices signify serious intent. As the bar fills up on a busy night, the conflict may become stark.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/11-01-2007/brera-w1/|On an early-days lunchtime, however, with the bar empty, the main emphasis was on the food, which fortunately measured up to the prices. Leaving aside a nice-looking basket of home-made breads – which disappointed on the taste front – what was notable was consistent quality of both preparation and presentation of this rich cuisine, even if there was nothing you could call earth-shattering. Service was amiable and efficient too.

More recently, the place has faded from prominence, however, so we ventured along to see if the new man – who has spent the past two years cooking for the trenderati at Soho House’s NYC outpost – has injected a bit of pizzazz.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/18-11-2005/restaurant-190-gore-hotel-sw7/|It turns out that this appears to be another of the false dawns to which this place seems periodically prone. That’s not to say the food is bad. A starter of scallops with braised peas was really quite good. But otherwise dishes varied from OK (a terrine and a risotto) to a total non-event (seared organic salmon salad). If you were staying in the adjoining hotel – which would not be a bad choice, if you’re looking for a bit of OTT English style – you’d not have much cause to complain. This is not food worth crossing town for, however.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/18-11-2005/restaurant-190-gore-hotel-sw7/|The dining room itself is quite grand, and furnished in a bohemian country house style – complete with large chandelier and mirrors – that makes it a pleasant rarity in town. The ambience never quite ignites, though. Perhaps if they ditched the paper napkins, and stopped sorting the cutlery so noisily, it might start to approach its potential.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/18-11-2005/restaurant-190-gore-hotel-sw7/|The best feature of this address is, mercifully, unaffected by the passing of the years. Before or after your meal, you can still enjoy a drink in one of the most characterful panelled cocktail bars in London. On this front, the PR-burble – ‘racy, raffish and oozing with intrigue’ –  really does seem to have it about right. The prominent Tory MP we bumped into certainly seemed to fit in very nicely.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-10-2007/marco-sw6/|London’s restaurants have come so far over the past 20 years – and particularly the past 10 – that the mere fact that a place offers good food doesn’t necessarily make it of particular interest. How else to explain why we found the latest addition to the Marco Pierre White empire to be both thoroughly competent and completely pointless?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-10-2007/marco-sw6/|But, first, let’s do the ‘competent’ bit: the cooking is generally very good. Highlights of a lunch included an unctuous crab bisque, a light and delicious kipper pÃ¢té, a beautiful and generous piece of cod and some splendid rib-eye steak. Marco’s signature lemon tart was also well up to standard. Further to accentuate the positive, the restaurant is handsome and solidly furnished – with that slightly sub-nightclub level of glitz the French often do well – and service is friendly and tries hard.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-10-2007/marco-sw6/|And yet’ The going here is going to be tough. This is, after all, a ‘graveyard’ site (two or three times in living memory). Unglamorously situated by the entrance to Chelsea FC, it benefits from significant pedestrian traffic on perhaps 20 days a year. The only natural source of ongoing walk-by business is the faceless adjoining hotel: presumably most people who stay there, however, are well aware that Chelsea proper is only five minutes away by cab.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-10-2007/marco-sw6/|If you were launching a restaurant on a site like that, you’d probably make darned sure that it had a Unique Selling Proposition – some compelling reason to seek it out. If there is one here, however, it passed us by. It’s almost as if Marco hasn’t noticed that a lot’s happened in the restaurant world since he built up most of his empire in the ’90s.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-10-2007/marco-sw6/|The menu, for example, is high-class, generic, modern French. Even in a more obvious site, we wonder if that formula wouldn’t seem a bit passé in a city where the trends are ‘grazing’, local sourcing and regionalism. It’s arguably a style that’s fine for business dining, but would anyone actively seek it out? And, if so, wouldn’t they be looking in Knightsbridge or Mayfair? Or Smithfield? And wouldn’t business diners expect a decent wine list? The one here verges on perfunctory.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-10-2007/marco-sw6/|So perhaps Marco’s got one eye to the locals? Well, the set lunch menu is exceptional value (2 courses for £16.50), but weekday business is thin out West (even in Chelsea proper). The weekend could perhaps be a opportunity, but the affluent folk who live round here often have kids. The carte, however, is mainly not child-suitable – oddly, as the place is named after one of his children – and no thought has been given to a kids’ menu or portions.

It’s a “classic, old-fashioned, small… restaurant” – but it’s also a bit different”. Yes, it’s “well lit and cosy”, the chairs are “soft and comfy”, staff are “gentle and friendly” and the food is “modest and humble and mostly very good”, but it’s also “hipsterish enough to feel relevant (but nothing to scare the horses)”. In “Portobello it feels new and relevant and youthful and British and thus almost revolutionary”.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|Under unchanged ownership, but new management, the Shoreditch premises once known as Beard-to-Tail still look rather as they did when we reviewed that informal bar-restaurant a year ago, not especially kindly. (Occasionally, we get things right!)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|This is still, it seems, a work-in-progress, and we were, on our visit, told that the woody (and, by night, rather glum-looking) rear dining room of the establishment would not be fully transformed till Christmas.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|Some of the important things, though, already seem to be going very much in the right direction: this struck us as a very handy sort of informal all-day restaurant even if it still does have a bit of work to do to impress the locals. We lunched pretty much alone. The welcome is warm, and the food - if not especially ambitious - was in a different league from our former visit.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|From the daytime menu - essentially a cut-down selection from the evening offering - we were able to try most of the types of dishes on offer. Tasty tomato bread, for example, made a good complement for a fresh-tasting assemblage of peas, beans and Feta-type cheese, and the brace of mini cheeseburgers were very decent too. Star of the show, though, was the tuna tataki - a nicely balanced small (but quite generous) plate and, in accordance with the fashion du jour, attractively florally enhanced.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|The drinks selection was inviting, and quite reasonably priced too. For lunch, a pint of Brooklyn - what else, round here? - made a very good accompaniment.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-11-2006/found-ec2/|This new restaurant and private member’s bar has been likened to “a gothic Claridges”. But aside from a quirky line in animal skulls (which make up a chandelier, wall lights, and just sit around on the bar), its airy décor fits firmly into the vaguely Manhattanite style that’s so familiar in the area. With its dark wood floors, steel pillars, and chocolate brown just about everything else, it’s classic Shoreditch.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-11-2006/found-ec2/|On my visit, the jovial barman was sporting a frilled “buccaneer” shirt. With his flowing locks, he looked a bit like a survivor from an early ’80s heavy metal band and added some much-needed raffish charm to what at lunch is still a pretty dead scene. At night-time, he told me, things are becoming much more happening (and on cue as he said this, someone poked their head round the door to nab a table for twelve at 9pm).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-11-2006/found-ec2/|The lunch menu is longer than the evening one, and classic modern British stuff. It didn’t put a foot wrong. Cauliflower soup was just the job for a cold day, and the slightly unusual addition of shrimps made a successful contribution to it. The preparation of a main dish of tuna (so often poor) was well judged, and its Japanese-y accompaniments which included seaweed, soy sauce and clean-out-your-sinuses wasabi were convincingly realised. Pudding was good, if not earth shattering: a combination of poached pears and chocolate goo (I’m sure it wasn’t called that).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-11-2006/found-ec2/|It’s no criticism of this good addition to the area that (though tempted to award four stars) we felt that to break our recent run of three-star awards might risk over-egging it. For a ‘different’ city lunch or a funky evening hang out, this seems a useful alternative to the nearby Great Eastern Dining Rooms.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|From the leading Muscovite restaurateur, a very large pan-Asian dining room that looks set to become a popular Mayfair destination, perhaps mainly for business; the smoothness of the operation on our early-days visit was impressive.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|If a success, this 400-seat Mayfair newcomer could quite possibly end up biggest-grossing restaurant in London. Comprising large dining rooms both Italian and Asian and an enormous basement bar, it’s roughly a third bigger than the D&D (‘Conran’) group’s Quaglino’s or Ramsay’s Bread Street, which are as big as quality London restaurants currently get.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|The Conran comparison is particularly apposite, as Arkady Novikov is the Sir Terence Conran of Moscow, just much bigger. Claiming 50 restaurants in the Russian capital, his empire is at least twice the size of D&D’s. That’s the sort of success that buys you toys such as Gianni Versace’s former house on Lake Como, as well as a handy townhouse in Knightsbridge.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|The new restaurant occupies a site where others have tried and failed, so the obvious question is: is Mayfair going to be Mr Novikov’s Waterloo? Initial impressions are indeed that the Italian restaurant feels like a bit of a ballroom – how is that going to work in a city where upmarket Italians are invariably on an intimate scale? The panelled basement bar, however, is a great space, which we suspect will become a popular rendezvous; let’s hope it doesn’t end up ALL Russians and their striking nieces.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|But our mission that day was to check out the on-your-way-in Asian restaurant. With its unadorned dark wood tables, and the glazed-in kitchen visible in the distance, it has a somewhat Identikit quality about it – not unpleasant, but not a particular attraction in its own right either. Pretty much ideal, then, for the sort of informal business lunching which had already drawn quite a good crowd by the time of our early-days visit.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|Service was notably on the ball. Perhaps Jamie and Gordon – home town boys both nominally responsible for major-early-days-service-fiascos in recent times – could learn a bit from the guys from Moscow?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|The real surprise, however, was the food – which was, with one exception, consistently impressive. The quality comes as more a shock, because a pan-Asian menu – by definition – lacks any sort of coherency. From a reviewing point of view, that makes it curiously easy, as you just have to order one of everything – sushi, skewers, dim sum, barbecue. All of the above were just very good, with the surprise highlight being a dish of truffled duck. The only dish that didn’t quite live up to its price tag (£45!) was some tempura lobster – not bad, just not really worth the expense. Otherwise, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. For Mayfair.

Nothing was unpleasant, but many dishes had a slight feeling of something missing. Bread was unremarkable. Starters of soups and antipasti didn’t quite make the grade.  A risotto wasn’t quite right, and a dish of lamb and roast potatoes lacked taste. Towards the end, however, things picked up. A foodie guest raved about the ice cream, and the chocolate tart with it really did melt (in the very best way), and the espresso was excellent.

This newcomer, however – an offshoot of an outfit from Geneva, and with outlets in Lisbon and Dubai – just seems like an authentic replica of uninspired restaurants everywhere.

The salad – marginally better than at de Venise – lost its advantage by being served up with dull bread. Steak/frites were a pretty much total disappointment. It does not help that your dinner plate arrives with the chips already on board – a school-diners style of service that has no place in even the humblest bistro. That special sauce – which had separated – seemed to add little to a pretty pallid bit of beef. If you try this place, we’d certainly recommend a good dose of Dijon to spice it up. A crème brûlée was pleasant enough, but we left our coffee undrunk.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/21-04-2010/vicino-sw6/|The change of name of the establishment long called De Cecco drew us back to this Parson’s Green Italian, which was established over two decades ago. It turns out that we’d been drawn on false pretences: there is no change of régime. It’s just that the Italian pasta company of the same name finally noted that their branding had, in their view, been appropriated. Needless to say, they didn’t take it as the compliment no doubt intended.

Companion had spaghetti al vongole which inspired much praise,as did the cheesecake. Bread and coffee were pretty good too. All in all, a meal that was ‘fit for purpose’, and more.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/17-01-2007/sitaaray-wc2/|Sitaaray feels as if it has had to make do with what was left of the building’s floorplan after the other occupants – not least the New London Theatre – had been taken care of. The best has been made of the small space, however, not least by inserting a couple of small mezzanines. These would be quite suited to romance, were it not for the fact they appear to have been earmarked for parties (of up to a dozen). The very red decorative style contributes to a feeling just the right side of claustrophobic, and a scattering of small TV screens showing Indian movies support the theme without being intrusive.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/17-01-2007/sitaaray-wc2/|Can you hear the alarm bells ringing? Theatreland location and ‘theme’ are not generally a whiz-bang formula for quality dining. The proprietors, however, also own Chor Bizarre in Mayfair – which has long been an Indian restaurant of some note – and a real effort seems to have been made. The emphasis is on grills, at reasonable prices. Good-value lunch and pre-theatre menus (all for £14.50 or less) are a speciality, and in the evenings parties can dine from an all-in selection for £18. On our visit, seafood – in particular king prawns and salmon – made a particular impression, and a rasmalai (cheese dessert) was also a hit. Service is charming too, if sometimes a bit slow. We never really drink wine in Indian restaurants, but, if you do, the selection here has received more attention than usual.

Well, how hard can it be drifting round restaurants, and scribbling a few words down about it afterwards? Not that hard, obviously. But nor is it quite the unmitigated joy many people seem to imagine. Yes, it’s always nice to be fed, but the number of places you  feel you’ve had an experience which is in any way special is, in truth, pretty small.

The tonality of the dining room is dark, but the look is now understated and informal, with well-spaced tables and comfortable chairs – all very agreeable, in a slightly Scandinavian way. In accordance with the general loosening up, the staff from the former régime, mainly charming Frenchmen, now wear jeans – clean and pressed Chelsea-style jeans, but jeans nonetheless. They seem to have benefited from their liberation.

Two of us tasted everything from the lunchtime menu, and had one of the most innovative and most enjoyable meals we can remember having in London, or anywhere else for that matter, for a very long time. There was almost nothing which was not a delight, from the choice of bread with the choice of butters with which the meal began, to the generous and perfectly ripe cheese selection and the artistically-presented range of petits-fours at the end – a meal with as much variety and interest as anyone could reasonably want (and all for £29 a head).

There is of course a famous exception – the founder of the movement, St John of Smithfield. But the vast majority of St John’s imitators and inspirees are pubs, or dining rooms attached to pubs.

It isn’t a pub at all. But this fact almost seems to have given them cold feet – so what was in former days a bar has been decked out to look like the dining room of a clapped-out boozer.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/11-07-2007/great-queen-street-wc2/|The great thing about GQS, as opposed to the A&H,is that you can book. The less good thing is that the food is less good. The manifest aim – as is evident the second you look at the A4 Xeroxed menu – is simplicity. Amen to that. Our choice ran crab on toast, beetroot salad, grilled plaice, cherry cake and crème caramel. But with simplicity, you do risk raising the issue: ‘could I make it at home’. And while the answer wasn’t in any case a yes, the skill in evidence by no means made the question absurd. There was none of the sense of genius-at-work in the kitchen that’s made the A&H such a mad success.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/11-07-2007/great-queen-street-wc2/|But let’s be positive.

Within a mile or so of each other, you can have places which are very good (Pétrus, say), and places which are mediocre (Foxtrot Oscar). It’s one of the mysteries of the celebrity-chefdom lark that these famous ‘brands’ have transcended the need to offer any particular level of quality or consistency. Aren’t brands supposed to have brand values?

Fortunately, it isn’t really. Occupying a congenial space just off Regent Street, once a branch of Piccolino, it’s a much more intimate affair than the echoey and under-charged City operation. Technically we’re in Mayfair, but spiritually not: Savile Row may be just around a couple of corners, but its hand-worked threads are not sported by the punters here.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/14-11-2014/heddon-street-kitchen/|If you’re looking for similarities with Bread Street, though, glance at the menu. The first thing you notice is that simplicity is not the order of the day, in the sense that many dishes need a sentence to describe them, rather than a phrase. The second thing you notice is that even when dishes sound as if you could do this at home, they come with impressive prices. A rib-eye steak, for example, is £34, Mutton pie £21. Our simple lunch, for one, making economical choices for each of three courses, with a glass of wine and an espresso, came to £55.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/14-11-2014/heddon-street-kitchen/|The food is not bad. Bread rolls have good taste and texture. A tuna tartare was nicely piquant. The ‘cuisson’ of  the sea bream (“with smoked aubergine, savoy cabbage, Castelluccio lentils and roast pumpkin”) was well enough judged, but finishing the dish was ultimately a bit of a chore. Perhaps a bit of crunch somewhere would not have gone amiss. The pear tart – the pudding most strongly recommended – was entirely as described, with no particular refinement or point of difference from a competent deli, and coffee likewise. The dishes came and went quickly: this is not really food to linger over.

Even Spain – with its diverse regions and cuisines – has few outposts aiming much above the tapas bar level. (And as to Germany’) It’s pleasing to note, then, the success in recent years of Lundums (the Danish restaurant in South Kensington) and of the Swedish Glas.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-12-2006/upper-glas-n1/|The new setting for Glas is very different.  Moved from its ‘small and percussive’ premises – as noted in an excellent guide we often use – by Borough Market, it now sits above Islington’s Antiques Market on the former site of Lola’s. It is light, lofty and well-spaced, and – for those well-disposed to Scandinavian-style understatement – possibly quite romantic.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-12-2006/upper-glas-n1/|On the culinary front, the main attraction is that the menu is different without being scary (herring excepted, obviously). One of the four breads offered, for example, is a very good home-made ryebread: Ryvita, eat your heart out. Starters, too, have rarity value. Sometimes that’s all they have: beer-battered beetroot with walnuts and thyme foam, for example, was just rather odd. A venison carpaccio, however, with a mushroom pannacotta (more a mousse) was a delicious dish, with a good range of tastes and textures (especially if you count the berries and nuts which seem to garnish almost everything).

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/25-05-2006/konstam-wc1/|Thanks to the location, they do indeed need all the PR they can get. Even the most accomplished estate agent might have to concede that this corner site – opposite a massage parlour, ten minutes’ walk from King’s Cross – is ‘difficult’. The interior – cobalt blue, and swathed with festoons of chainmail – is certainly ‘different’, though, and pleasing too. It positively shimmered the sunny lunchtime I visited. Initial service impressions were also favourable.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/25-05-2006/konstam-wc1/|As it turns out, the only thing wrong with this place is the food. Wandsworth-baked bread, brought immediately, was fine – white, chewy and, in a good way, very English. But who in their right mind would serve olive oil with bread like that? It made no sense. Neither, really, did Chesham goat’s cheese nettles  pirogi, which tasted as unappetising as they looked; a few greasy breadcrumbs on top did not help. A Canvey Dover sole was plated up complete with head, skin and roe. The flesh had admittedly been grilled to perfection, but the accompanying spinach verged on inedible. A baked cheesecake was a great wodge of a thing, with a claggy base, and accompanied by an ungainly dollop of rhubarb jam. After this multiple assault, only a strong post-prandial filter coffee stopped me feeling slightly queasy.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/25-05-2006/konstam-wc1/|So, as you’ll gather, I can’t really recommend this brave new venture, which is a shame.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/26-11-2007/gazette-sw11/|When you see menu of this notably unpretentious all-day joint, which opened up near the Battersea riverside early in 2007, you may feel that you have stumbled into some sort of Francophile heaven. This double-page job – printed up freshly every day – offers dishes ranging from pancakes and croques-messieurs to quite ambitious plats du jour – perfect, it seems, for everything from lunch with the kids to an informal romantic dinner (if you avoid the football evenings, that is). There is an excellent range of French wines (and other drinks) too, all at reasonable prices.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/26-11-2007/gazette-sw11/|Sadly, on our visit, the food just did not live up to the promise. Bread set a upbeat note, and a reasonably-priced kids’ pasta special was also good, but there were just too many duds. That’s not to say that there’s any want of generosity – if anything, portions are too big – but a seafood chowder was impossibly salty, and both a venison plat du jour and a floating island would have benefited from being half the size and twice as subtle. Coffee was also indifferent.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-05-2013/ottos-wc1/|The idea that a restaurant is an extension of the personality, even the home, of its proprietor is common in France. Witness the number of restaurants called ‘Chez’ quelqu’un. But you see it surprisingly rarely here. In London, the aim of mid-market restaurants often seems to be de-personalised good taste, rather than any expression of character, or still less of personality.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-05-2013/ottos-wc1/|So we noticed when Otto (for it was he) greeted us as we entered this Bloomsbury restaurant, and was there as we left, too – discussing the menu for that evening with one of his staff. We also noticed that the interior, in a light and airy period room in Bloomsbury, is decked out with that quirky, slightly domestic, taste that the French often apply to restaurants, but which an Englishman would somehow find embarrassing.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-05-2013/ottos-wc1/|As at so many French restaurants, the aim is to do classic dishes well rather than to aim for any particular novelty. Thus our lunch menu for two comprised terrine and scallops, steak and seabass. Nothing to startle, then, but it was striking that everything – from the decent crispy baguette (for once) to the coffee – was done consistently well, and sometimes very well indeed.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-05-2013/ottos-wc1/|For a lunchtime discussion in an unhurried and restful setting, we doubt that – anywhere in the centre of our great city – you could have done very much better than we did on on the day of our visit. And, by night, we fancy this must be quite an old-fashioned-romantic place too.

Are we imagining it, or is there a bit of a spate of restaurant at the moment which are very nice in every way’ except that the food is entirely unremarkable? The new Italian restaurant on the Chelsea site that was formerly called Aubergine (same ownership), would appear to be a classic example.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/16-04-2011/11-park-walk-sw10/|Our initial impressions were that the interior has been given a radical – but elegant and comfortable – make-over, of the type you might describe as being suitable for ‘civilised family parties’, and that the all-Italian service is utterly charming.

We have a theory – doubtless we’ve shared it with you before if you read our reviews with any regularity – that you can usually tell everything you need to know about a restaurant from its bread. This was a classic example – the basket of brown and white breads which arrived was undistinguished in both taste and texture, and owed nothing obvious to Italy.

Perhaps it’s because restaurateurs can’t, in current market conditions, cash out advantageously from properties they’d otherwise be happy to exit, so they decide that the next best thing is to have a bit of a wash and brush-up.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2008/searcys-ec2/|We don’t know anything, however, about the specific motivations of Searcy’s 1847 (as they are now called) in refurbishing their property which enjoys a view of the Barbican ‘lake’. The former caterers – who are now seeking to make quite a name as restaurateurs too – have not only refurbished it, they have also ‘relaunched’ it. That, it seems, happens when you not only brush up the décor, but also the culinary format.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2008/searcys-ec2/|First problem, however, was that we couldn’t actually see any obvious physical changes. We were therefore very grateful to our helpful and engaging waiter for pointing out that the carpet had changed colour, and that there was now a new dining bar where solo diners can eat watching the goings-on by the lake. For a place that had just been ‘relaunched’, though, we’d have to say the overall impression was one of continuity (and, let’s be frank, just a little bit dreary – these ’70s spaces take quite a lot of livening up). It didn’t help that the place, admittedly in the first week of its new guise, was pretty much empty for lunch.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2008/searcys-ec2/|If the setting still seems a little retro, however, the menu has been brought bang up-to-date, in the sense that it is defiantly English. We do wonder about the general appeal of this style. Most of us – and this will apply particularly to the less metropolitan sort of diner you may find in a cultural destination like the Barbican – have been brought up to  feel happier with a French, Anglo-French or Italian menu than we do with a thoroughbred English one.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2008/searcys-ec2/|The result of all this Englishness, can, in short, be a menu which lacks ‘easy’ appeal: there was nothing on the menu that our (professional-diner) lunching companion really wanted. That’s not to denigrate the aim, which is a worthy one, but we suspect that this whole English thing – it its extreme form – may be a bit of a fad, and that we’ll shortly all go back to the sort of Anglo-French stuff that’s done quite nicely for the last century or so (if, perhaps, with more English dishes, and a bit more emphasis on local provenance). That’s not to criticise the realisation or presentation of the food  we tried, though, which was thoroughly good, if not, of itself, a sufficient reason to seek the place out.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-05-2009/whitechapel-gallery-dining-room-e1/|London’s galleries and museums tend to offer little of interest on the food front. Part of the problem is that, big and institutional bodies as they are, they tend to appoint big, joyless catering companies to do the job for them.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-05-2009/whitechapel-gallery-dining-room-e1/|All credit, then, to the relaunched Whitechapel Gallery, which has taken an independent approach to its in-house restaurant. The result is an establishment which doesn’t feel at all institutional. It may be symbolic that, though you enter through the gallery entrance, the restaurant overlooks a busy (and not especially attractive) streetscape, which tends to suggest that this is a ‘real’ restaurant that just happens to be attached to an art gallery. (Perhaps this really is the “ace cafe with a museum attached” of which the V&A once famously boasted.)

A ham hock terrine, for example, comes elegantly laid out, and accompanied by nicely-timed quail’s eggs and still-warm asparagus. Bream comes similarly well presented, with mash and beetroot. Even the few elements involved in a dish of good treacle tart and crème fraÃ®che are carefully composed. Bread and coffee are well above average.

Prices are just a touch higher than you might hope. Bread does not come gratis. Service rather comes and goes. But all these are details.

For our taste, the impression is still that of dining at the finest hotel in Ruritania – opulent, certainly, but not cosy or stylish.

The menu lacks many obvious staples, and the presentation of oysters, for example, is plain wrong. How can they present them other than nestling in a beguiling bed of ice, ideally on a stand? An unadorned china plate, albeit with six little subdivisions, is a sad and lazy substitute. And what about the bread, which is charged for?

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/01-05-2008/hix-oyster-chop-house-ec1/|Where do you spend the weekend before the launch? In the kitchen, fine-tuning the menu? In the dining room anxiously ensuring everything is ready to receive the punters? Or perhaps on a stepladder outside, making sure they’ve got your name up right? Er, no. If you’re Mark Hix, you spend it at a conference in New Orleans.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/01-05-2008/hix-oyster-chop-house-ec1/|This single fact tells you almost everything you need to know about the priorities of the modern chef/media persona. It doesn’t matter that you’re on the very brink of opening your first solo restaurant, bearing your very own name – what’s most important is to be off hob-nobbing with other foodie luminaries.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/01-05-2008/hix-oyster-chop-house-ec1/|Now, if Mr Hix’s Smithfield restaurant had actually been ready to open, firing on all cylinders, on the appointed day, such commentary would be irrelevant. But, even towards the end of the first week, its performance was still very ragged indeed. The table layout was still being tinkered with, service was still very slow (and notably disjointed), and deliveries (such as that all-important ironing board) were still being received through the front door.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/01-05-2008/hix-oyster-chop-house-ec1/|Mr Hix’s contribution? Well, obviously, he was swanning around the dining room, lapping up the adulation from his mates in the trade for the undoubted success he clearly presumes this will be. So far as we could see, such friends got ‘comped’ (ie their bills torn up). As the early-days feeling of the enterprise so clearly called for the sort of first-week/soft-opening discount which is pretty common nowadays, we therefore awaited the arrival of our own reckoning with particular interest.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/01-05-2008/hix-oyster-chop-house-ec1/|No luck: full prices already, undeservedly, being charged. And it’s not as if some of the prices couldn’t stand a bit of pruning. A £6.75 pudding, for example, comprised a ‘scone’ (pancake), a small ball of ice cream and some honey. And, if you’re running a (full-price) Oyster & Chop house, shouldn’t you already have your sourcing sorted out, to the extent that you can offer a ‘choice’ of more than two types of oyster?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/01-05-2008/hix-oyster-chop-house-ec1/|The actual quality of what we consumed was actually pretty good, but – though meat was impressive – there was little remarkable about our meal. A pennywort ‘salad’ was composed of items presented together, rather than having been brought together, and an incidental dish of bubble ‘n’ squeak was totally without interest.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/01-05-2008/hix-oyster-chop-house-ec1/|So, from us, rather a guarded welcome for Mr Hix’s newcomer. Let’s just hope it settles in to be as good as he clearly expects it’s going to be.

By the late-90s, a retro-style of English cooking was beginning to evolve (or, more accurately, be rediscovered), which might be described - for want of any better term - as gastropub-style cooking. Then, by the mid-00s, people were beginning to figure out that there wasnt any
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/nw1/market.htm|Recent times have seen the creation of establishments such as 32 Great Queen Street, which - being asssociated with the famous Anchor & Hope - has all the style of a gastropub, but no pub. In a different way, the smart modernist Canteen chain has also made quite a success by disassociating gastropub-style cooking from the gastropub-style environment.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/nw1/market.htm|And so things go full circle, and we now see establishments such as Market, which is for all the world like a classic no-nonsense Gallic bistro (or café, as the French might call it), except for the fact that everything about it is resolutely English.  Mackerel pÃ¢te n toast, pollack n chips, fruit crumble n custard - thats the sort of fare you find done here. And all - on the basis of our lunch for three - consistently done very well here.

But the number of would-be Saturday lunchers we saw turned away suggests that this South Kensington newcomer would have been jam-packed anyway.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/15-04-2009/rocca-di-papa-sw7/|So what are the attractions? Well, friendly staff with a can-do attitude make up one part of the package. And the lofty and spacious interior is smartly decked out too, if in the slightly bland sort of way that says this hopes to be a chain one day. The food is rather in keeping with the décor, but the pizzas and pastas were generally reasonably satisfying.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/15-04-2009/rocca-di-papa-sw7/|So ‘just’ a goodish all-rounder, then. But a reasonably priced one too, in an area that is rather lacking in such things at the moment. (There’s no PizzaExpress, for example, within easy walking distance.)

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-10-2009/polpo-w1/|We keep reading that this much-lauded Soho newcomer – fronted by Russell Norman, once a bigwig at the Caprice group – is some sort of Venetian snack bar (or, to impress you with our research,
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-10-2009/polpo-w1/|). Has anyone looked at it? This is a New York restaurant, pure and simple. Or, more specifically, a Downtown restaurant.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-10-2009/polpo-w1/|The only wonder is that it’s taken so long for this particular style of deconstructed chic to make the jump from SoHo to Soho: Polpo immediately reminded us a of a particular SoHo-fringe operation, Peasant, which opened as long ago as 2000. Mr Norman readily admits such restaurants (if not that specific one) have provided just as much inspiration for him as anything in La Serenissima, and will even tell you the name of the particular firm of Big Apple architects whose work has inspired him: Avroko.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-10-2009/polpo-w1/|True to the Avroko spirit, Norman has opened up some beautifully distressed brickwork (heading for three centuries old), and some tiles (we’d guess Victorian) to create an interior which – though on a modest scale compared to many Downtown establishments – has a rather similar vibe. As in NYC, that vibe manages to be trendy but not exclusive. We couldn’t help noticing how, in the pretty much full house by 1pm, there were lots of people – yes, even including old people -who weren’t classic modern-times Soho lunchers at all. Early days, but the tone may well last.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-10-2009/polpo-w1/|It isn’t just the styling, of course (not generally commented on in the very positive early-days reviews elsewhere) which is responsible for the crush, but also the much-complimented food. Not that the cuisine is in any way astonishing, it’s just that it is generally very well done, and amazingly, well,
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-10-2009/polpo-w1/|. The cicheti (Italian tapas) are very tasty, as well as remarkably economical. The highlight for us (lunching in the singular) was a delicious pile of green tapenade on a piece of toasted bread, but arancini (rice balls) also satisfied. To follow, fegato alla Veneziana, a small but very adequate dish for around £6, was well complemented by a plate of zucchini dressed with olive oil. Add a plate of roast autumn fruits (the best dish, dressed with a sprinkle of crumble), and you’ve still, with modest wine, had a very pleasant lunch for £25. Which may be another reason the place is already humming.

Or both. So how long till the successor restaurant? As you’ve probably gathered, this is not the sort of place where a known reviewer is likely to be able to maintain any sort of anonymity, so we can tell you what Mr Norman told us – start looking out for number two some time next year.

Starters included some excellent chaat and delicious fried squid.  Among the main dishes, the stand-outs were Fish Balchao – where tilapia fish had been cooked in a beautifully-spiced sauce – and a deeply intense lamb curry (it’s Roghan Josh Jim, but not as we know it). Unusually for any kind of Indian restaurant, the best was kept till last with a magnificent finale of red chilli ice cream.

(It seems to us that this is a distinction that’s becoming pretty much irrelevant: many pubs are now really informal restaurants, and some restaurants are now adopting ‘gastropub’ style. What, apart from architecture, is the meaningful distinction between the two?)

Like all their old boozers, it’s been made a bit squeaky-clean in a way that isn’t necessarily totally congenial. That’s not to deny, however, that the overall effect is smart, and comfortable enough: as much like a spruced up gentleman’s club as a pub (and, indeed, there are some billiard tables upstairs). The service, however, is matey, in an Antipodean sort of way.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-06-2009/cadogan-arms-sw3/|The menu is more in keeping with the décor than the service.  Though shorter than the one at the frankly brasserie-like Botanist, just up the road, it’s not so different in style, which is to say it is not notably pubby at all. Our meal for one included some good and interesting bread, an elegant pea soup, a pretty good cheesecake and a decent espresso. The only dull moment was a rather salty chicken pie, with an unimpressive hat, which came with a slick of not especially appealing mash.

All I could tell from the Yakitoria press release was that it was at the heart of the ginmormous new development that looms over the A40 by Paddington Station.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-12-2005/yakitoria-w2/|Expecting a faceless corporate jungle, I was pleasantly amazed by the whole area. You leave the rear of Paddington Station (by the Hammersmith & City line), to join a network of recently-built paths around the Grand Union canal, some areas of which have apparently been opened for the first time in 200 years. In less than 10 minutes, you can now stroll from Paddington into impossibly cute Little Venice.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-12-2005/yakitoria-w2/|And on the way, you pass this chic-looking new Japanese. Huge picture windows give the ground floor (there’s also a basement) a fine view of the canal, while the very airy interior is a stylish medley of slate, dark-stained timber, and green velvet drapes. If I hadn’t known that it was the creation of a Russian restaurant group, I would have thought that it was a third opening by Rainer Becker of Roka and Zuma fame.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-12-2005/yakitoria-w2/|The fashionable Japanese menu is reminiscent of Roka’s with its emphasis on skewers from the charcoal robata grill, alongside a wide selection of sushi and main dishes. I went for a catholic selection incorporating five kinds of skewer and some trendy sounding ‘spicey red-eye’ and ‘garden’ sushi — the former spiked with chilli pepper, the latter using ingredients like burdock. None of the items were disappointing, but equally all fell short of being inspirational.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-12-2005/yakitoria-w2/|Service was charming but a little keystone kops-ish (or whatever it is that Russians say for being disorganised and amateurish).

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-07-2013/hutong-se1/|It used to be easy. High-rise restaurants in London were few, small and expensive, and everyone knew they were primarily there to rip off tourists, birthday celebrants and romantics. Yet, as London reaches for the stars, such restaurants have suddenly become so numerous as to seem almost unremarkable. Take the lift to the 33rd floor of the Shard, for example, and you find a complex comprising not one but two Aqua-group restaurants (Aqua Shard, British in style, as well as Hutong), and also a brasserie-style operation (Oblix) run by Rainer Becker of Zuma fame – the bars and dining rooms can accommodate hundreds of guests in total. (And that’s before a Shangri-La hotel opens in the same building at the end of the year.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-07-2013/hutong-se1/|The landlords must have been cutting good deals, because space is used at these new establishments in a lavish way which those of us used to the West End’s cosy ways can find it difficult to adjust to. Indeed, these vast air-conditioned expanses often just feel rather dead. And how can the actual dining rooms compete with the views, anyway? On our daytime visit, none of the Shard restaurant interiors filled us with any great excitement. Of the three, however, we suspect that the dark and dimly-lit interior of Hutong – the swankiest of the establishments – is the one that would work best by night. By day, leaving the view out of the reckoning, we felt as if we were lunching in one of the more upmarket of Mr Disney’s resort-hotel dining rooms (and not an especially comfortable one either).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-07-2013/hutong-se1/|The dim sum menu – not especially helpfully divided up, in the way you’d find in Chinatown – seemed a good place to try a range of tastes, but the affable waiter steered us to the pre-chosen steamed selection from the main menu. These came prettily colour coded, not something we can really recall before, but the differences of hue among the selection was more pronounced than the differences of taste – in every other way they hit the spot, though, and they certainly delivered quite a chilli kick.

By then we were pretty much full, so pudding was steamed custard buns, presented as mice or, quite possibly porcupines – quite amusing, though the taste was not particularly remarkable.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/sw1/no-11-pimlico-road.htm|The same adjective could also be applied to the cuisine. This is, they say, intended to be a female-friendly sort of establishment, and the menu is long on snack-style dishes, including salads. Thats by no means to say theyre all lo-cal - our chicken schnitzel and chips was very good on both counts, though the portions might not satisfy a true trencherman. Bread was very good too, and came in a nice variety, even if they do charge for it. Prepare yourself for a real sugar high, but the rhubarb roulade - again, no real economiser on the calories - was a real highlight of a visit in which none of three people found anything really to fault.

It’s had a bit of a makeover, but the most eye-catching thing about  the place – some of whose windows have false bottle-glass – is that it still feels as if it should be in a Surrey high street, rather than one of the priciest postcodes in the world. Perhaps that’s part of its charm. The crowd on the day of our visit was also less glitzy than such a location might suggest.

Perhaps we were just lucky, but it really was just the job. The chips were particularly interesting. Fat chips can be horrible, but these were exemplarily moreish in both their taste and their crispy texture. The tart also rated mention, steering that difficult middle course between being heavy handedly rustic on the one hand and too poncey on the other. Incidentals such as bread (made, for once, on the premises) and coffee were also well up to scratch.

Blame the powers that be, who – in a top dollar joint like this – should have given her a bit more basic training. They should also, while they were at it, have made sure that the coffee and credit card machines were working, and avoided the numerous interruptions by various members of staff updating us on their bungling progress in trying to rectify matters.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-08-2008/mint-leaf-lounge-ec2/|And the food? OK, this was the bar menu. Even allowing for this, portions are outrageously dinky. A £6.50 portion of asparagus, involved maybe two spears (or was it three?) pretentiously chopped up and served skewered by multiple cocktail sticks on a tiny little mound of coconut rice – the sort of portion you might feed to a mouse in a cartoon. Stuffed peppers? £7!
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-08-2008/mint-leaf-lounge-ec2/|A £28 seafood sharing platter for two might have fed two Lilliputians, but for two regular-sized adults it looked so tiny, we initially presumed it was for just one of us, and they were about to go back for the same again. What a hoot! One cute, litte spicy seafood parcel each. But how to divide the last of the three prawns? If they wanted to starve us, at least they could do so with evenly numbered bites. And, yes folks, that’s over £5 per morsel.

The food is really enjoyable, spicey, carefully put together, but there just ain’t enough of it. He nodded, said he might make some changes, and scuttled off looking a bit uncertain.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|**Note (27 June): We hear that, since this review was written, the ‘launch’ chef has left, and Pierre Koffmann himself is – at least for the time being – in charge of the stoves.**
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|If you know who’s ‘behind’ a forthcoming restaurant, you’re unlikely to go that far wrong as to what the end product is like. So if you know that a new brasserie is to be opened by Claudio Pulze (whose 50 previous establishments include everything from Aubergine and Zafferano) you expect something pretty useful. And all the more so when he’s in league with Pierre Koffmann.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|Koffmann may not be a household name nowadays, but – if you take out the empire-building, self-promoting and foul-mouthed bits – he was the Gordon Ramsay of the nineties. His Tante Claire restaurant – on the site now the Ramsay HQ – was invariably London’s best. Then he moved TC to the Berkeley Hotel site which is now Pétrus, and didn’t prosper. He dropped out of sight for a while, and his return has long been rumoured.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|Amazingly, however, almost everything about the new restaurant manages to some extent to be wrong. It doesn’t help that this is a site with poor proportions, and a bit of a chequered history to boot. (To make it all the more confusing, it’s not so long ago that it was called Pétrus.) It’s been done over as a straight down-the-line Gallic brasserie which, without any patina of age, just looks a little bit cold and univiting.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|The service was often pleasant, but it seemed to come and go rather. And couldn’t the waiter have mentioned we were over-ordering? Our main dish came not only with the spuds and greens we had ordered, but also with some unadvertised rice and vegetables which, as it turned out, were included anyway. It added insult to injury when the unnecessary bowl of spinach came at £1 per teaspoonful.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|Pretty decent bread included a good pain de campagne. Unfortunately, however, this was also served as the complement to the foie gras terrine, when the traditional brioche would have been infinitely better. A main course of kidneys was perfectly workmanlike, but – for £16 – didn’t have the feeling of coming with a great deal of Tante Claire heritage, even if, garnished, it arguably made a decent-value dish, at least by St James’s standard. The same could not be said of the uninviting, soggy rum baba.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|So, £60 for a pretty basic lunch for one, with two glasses of wine and one cup of coffee.

After all, how often have each of us wished we weren’t facing a car ride or train journey home after a great meal? But ‘restaurants-with-rooms’ are more than just convenient, they are destinations. A way to get out of the city or to celebrate an occasion and, of course, to experience dining out as part of a total experience – always more difficult among the clamour of competing attractions in a city. So, this week, we bring you some of the best restaurants-with-rooms.

With such a strong lunchtime food emphasis and nowhere to stand around with a glass, ‘wine bar’ wouldn’t do. The term ‘bistro’ can sound rather dated. So the solution the owners of this Farringdon newcomer have opted for is to call it a ‘Bar and wine shop’. With its bare tables, daily-changing blackboard menu and open kitchen, however, the place looked for all the world like a ‘contemporary bistro’ on our lunchtime visit (and an instantly-popular one at that).

At the bottom end, you’ll pay the standard three times retail, but, if you drink better, the proportional mark-up, never exceeding £25, falls away sharply. By night, you can stop by just for a drink – for consumption sur place, or to take away.

There are now half a dozen Maroushes proper, and roughly the same again of spin-off brands such as Ranoush and Beirut Express.

For £12, you get tasty olives, a huge and impressively fresh salad and vegetable bowl, bread, two hot and two cold starters, a meaty dish of the day with rice, and some pastries. Even with a glass of wine and an extremely passable espresso, you can still get away around the £20 a head mark (plus a tip). By night, when broadly the same meal would cost twice as much, the attractions of the perfectly palatable but fairly unremarkable cuisine would be rather less apparent.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w1/polpo.htm|We keep reading that this much-lauded Soho newcomer - fronted by Russell Norman, once a bigwig at the Caprice group - is some sort of Venetian snack bar (or, to impress you with our research,
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w1/polpo.htm|). Has anyone looked at it? This is a New York restaurant, pure and simple. Or, more specifically, a Downtown restaurant.

Mr Norman readily admits such restaurants (if not that specific one) have provided just as much inspiration for him as anything in La Serenissima, and will even tell you the name of the particular firm of Big Apple architects whose work has inspired him: Avroko.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w1/polpo.htm|True to the Avroko spirit, Norman has opened up some beautifully distressed brickwork (heading for three centuries old), and some tiles (wed guess Victorian) to create an interior which - though on a modest scale compared to many Downtown establishments - has a rather similar vibe. As in NYC, that vibe manages to be trendy but not exclusive. We couldnt help noticing how, in the pretty much full house by 1pm, there were lots of people - yes, even including old people -who werent classic modern-times Soho lunchers at all. Early days, but the tone may well last.

Not that the cuisine is in any way astonishing, its just that it is generally very well done, and amazingly, well,
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w1/polpo.htm|. The cicheti (Italian tapas) are very tasty, as well as remarkably economical. The highlight for us (lunching in the singular) was a delicious pile of green tapenade on a piece of toasted bread, but arancini (rice balls) also satisfied. To follow, fegato alla Veneziana, a small but very adequate dish for around £6, was well complemented by a plate of zucchini dressed with olive oil. Add a plate of roast autumn fruits (the best dish, dressed with a sprinkle of crumble), and youve still, with modest wine, had a very pleasant lunch for £25. Which may be another reason the place is already humming.

The attraction can’t be the interior – pleasant enough, but feeling as much like a low-lit wine bar as it does a restaurant of ambition.

The combination of the Jersusalem artichoke cheesecake (a conceit of David Everitt-Matthias, of Cheltenham’s Champignon Sauvage, it seems)  with peanut ice cream and a knob of peanut butter was truly inspired – one of those rare dishes where the whole really does end up tasting of more than the sum of its parts.

The last time London saw three stars was in 2010 when Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester won the accolade. Before that you have to go back to 2004 when Heston’s Fat Duck got its third star. The Fat Duck, we get. But Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester? As our survey reporters say it’s simply “not in the same league” and how it retains its three-star rating year-after-year is a mystery.

Perhaps the guide editors were feeling a bit nostalgic about Bibendum’s home in Chelsea’s iconic Michelin Building, because the reports we have had this year don’t point towards a two-star performance. Overall it received a 2/5 for food in our survey and many seem to think the more ambitious culinary regime has led to “ridiculous prices”.

Our reporters say, and we agree, that Andrew Wong’s new-school Chinese in Pimlico provides some of “the most exhilarating food in London”. However there are a couple of omissions that (we feel) continue to rankle. Gauthier Soho lost its star in 2012 and its continued absence from the list is baffling and starkly calls into question the judgement of the tyre men. And while we’re on the subject, why was Chelsea’s Medlar stripped of its star? Perhaps most confusing though is why Michelin continues to ignore Bethnal Green’s Typing Room? As one survey reporter says: “How this place doesn’t have a Michelin star is beyond belief!”

Furnished, seemingly, from a car boot sale, its small interior features principally a large bar at which the seats, thanks to an almost total absence of leg room, are fearsomely uncomfortable.

But the proud boast ‘Toulouse and London’ is a novelty. (Indeed, the only recent provincial-French incursion into the capital that springs to mind is by the Michelin-bedecked Pourcel brothers from Montpellier, whose West End opening W’sens is thought in many quarters to make no sense at all.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/20-01-2006/les-coulisses-ec2/|Far from being your cliché sleepy Gallic outfit, the Toulouse original is the sort of place which aims to be a bar as much as a restaurant, complete with a website playing groovy ambient beats. The aims and appearance of its new dark ‘n’ lilac City namesake are in the same vein. There is an ‘after-work party every day’, and the classic regional dishes on offer include a smoked salmon ‘n’ vodka combo. You may be in Broadgate, but spiritually you’re supposed to be in St Tropez: the place advertises itself as the ‘French Riviera in London Heart’ (sic). (Toulouse’s connection with the Riviera is not explained.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/20-01-2006/les-coulisses-ec2/|Many aspects of the place have Gallic authenticity. The smiley staff all seem to have been imported from HQ. The large carte is amusingly packed with mis-spellings and mis-translations, and its diverse offerings are a reminder of just how much France’s huge culinary repertoire tends to be abbreviated for rosbif consumption.

This promise, however, was only inconsistently realised. A steak – generous by British standards – was satisfying, but two other main course meat dishes were little more than pricey meatballs. Bread and puds impressed, and coffee too, while wines include an unusual selection from Béarn (on the fringe of the Basque Country).

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/31-03-2010/ptrus-sw1/|The recent history of Gordon Ramsay, his group and its recent financial travails is too well known to repeat here. Let’s just say that we’re not the only people to believe that a lot hangs on the success of this Belgravia newcomer. (It’s being needlessly promoted as a relaunch, but the earlier Pétrus at the nearby Berkeley Hotel – now trading under the name of the original chef, Marcus Wareing –  stopped bearing that name over a year ago. This is for all intents and purposes a new operation, with both a new location and a new chef.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/31-03-2010/ptrus-sw1/|Will Pétrus mark the beginning of a new chapter? Can Ramsay clearly demonstrate that, after all the ups and downs, his new restaurant launches are consistent with his status as the most famous chef in the English-speaking world?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/31-03-2010/ptrus-sw1/|Short answer: maybe. The new establishment was already hitting an impressive stride at lunch on the second day of operation. Admittedly, one of our party was known to the maÃ®tre d’ (and we were therefore subjected to a blinding charm offensive), but the staff managed to create an impression that was keen and caring, rather than oleaginous. The main complaint was the longeur before the arrival of the main course’ but then it was day two.

Our meal came with a whole battery of amuses and inter-courses: fancy popcorn, small cup of velouté, scallops with tempura-ish cauliflower, tiny lemon-cream cone, cheese with beetroot, ice lolly served with dry ice’!

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/31-03-2010/ptrus-sw1/|There really wasn’t a dud among them. Highlights which remain in the memory include the marvellous meat in a dish of duck in ginger sauce; a classic but perfectly executed dish of pork and black pudding; and a superbly sinful ‘chocolate sphere’. Ooghs and aaghs, though? These were notable by their absence.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/31-03-2010/ptrus-sw1/|The menu has that unmissable Ramsay stamp. This is true not only in the literal sense – in that the group’s menus tend to look very similar, even down to a house font – but also in the nature of the dishes themselves. Riffs on Gallic classics, you might say. It’s a can’t-go-wrong style, perfect for entertaining investments bankers anywhere. But, for us, that feeling – go on Gordon, surprise us a bit; inject a bit of drama into our lives – went unanswered.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/31-03-2010/ptrus-sw1/|The impressions of ‘safety first’ – but a lack of any real progression – is reinforced by the dining room. Although different designers were employed, Pétrus both looks and feels just like its Mayfair stablemate Murano, which opened 16 months ago – indeed, arguably a little less luxurious. Despite the expensively cylindrically-glazed wine ‘cellar’ in the centre of the room, the décor has anonymity which would suit a small upmarket hotel in any part of the world where gold or black Amex cards are the usual method of payment.

The f-word chef – not in evidence on our visit, as he was apparently dropping in on his new Maze in Doha (was he trying to make a point?) – has remotely launched a restaurant which shows that he can, with the help of some of his longest-serving staff, launch a new establishment of an unimpeachably high standard.

This long-established bistro has been through some ups and downs of late. It turns out that Luc, the founder, had been out of the picture for the past few years, but the régime he put in place only finally hit the buffers a few months ago.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-10-2006/lucs-bistro-deluxe-ec3/|Now, it really is all-change. The new gaffer is none other than Simon Binder who, one of the staff told us, has launched no fewer than 80 restaurants. As he set up the Café Med group, this apparently implausible claim is quite possibly true. Philippe Lhermitte –  scion of the family which has run the Covent Garden bistro Mon Plaisir for over half a century – is general manager. With these sorts of people behind the place, you’d think it couldn’t go wrong, and fortunately you’d be right.

In its tightly-packed way, this remains one of London’s more convivial dining spaces. It has been made a dash more feminine, but, at least in the early days, the clientèle remains resolutely chappish.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-10-2006/lucs-bistro-deluxe-ec3/|Given the management changes, it’s perhaps odd how closely the menu of the ‘new’ establishment resembles that of the old.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-05-2009/the-wine-theatre-se1/|The rather intriguing name drew us to this South Bank newcomer, near Blackfriars Bridge. It turns out that it’s a handy enough destination if you should find yourself in that neck of the woods, but – with the qualification at the end of this short piece – we would find it difficult to recommend any sort of trip.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-05-2009/the-wine-theatre-se1/|Firstly, it’s not at all theatrical. The space is carved out of a building otherwise occupied by a Travelodge. Let’s just say it does not transcend its location.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-05-2009/the-wine-theatre-se1/|Secondly, the wines – though perfectly adequate – fell well short of any sort of distinction. As a sweeping generalisation, the wine lists in London’s restaurants are probably of greater note, by international standards, than their menus. In the face of such competition, the list here, frankly, doesn’t cut it.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-05-2009/the-wine-theatre-se1/|Thirdly, the food. Let’s just pose one question: why would any restaurant which wasn’t avowedly ‘French’ offer a ‘classic’ (cotton wool) London baguette, when almost any other type of bread – from ciabatta to wholemeal –  would almost certainly be done much better? What followed at our three-course lunch for one was not particularly bad, but nothing about it really upset the mundane impression that had been made by the bread basket.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-05-2009/the-wine-theatre-se1/|But let’s end on an upbeat note. What we didn’t get to sample was the early-evening menu (5.30pm – 8pm), but it apparently offers buffet nibbles – to those drinking modest quantities of wine – free, gratis and for nothing. That sounds like the sort of value that really might be worth crossing bridges for.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-06-2013/story-se1/|It’s fortunate that this island-site Borough restaurant, not far from Tower Bridge, has had some good early-days reviews, as it’s certainly not a destination that’s ever going to make much of a living from its passing pedestrian traffic! And those who do stroll by are hardly likely just to pop in for the entry-level menu – six courses for £45.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-06-2013/story-se1/|The interior of the newly-built structure is similarly a bit of a surprise. It felt a bit like a smart, Scandinavian-style ski-lodge, decorated with bookshelves (complete with artfully disorganised volumes) and G-Plan furniture. We never particularly warmed to this interior, perhaps largely because it seemed to be the sonic equivalent of a black hole – voices often just disappeared, even over distances where this would seem impossible.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-06-2013/story-se1/|Like all good stories, the actual meal begins with the arrival of an old fashioned lighted candle. But in this story, you eat it; we won’t spoil it for you. And then the amuse-bouches arrive. If your meal is anything like ours, this is the point at which you may begin to believe that this is one story which will have a happy ending. The nibbles are all carefully-crafted, and not at all what they initially seem, such as a sliver of cod skin that’s been toasted to the consistency of a cracker. Or there’s an Oreo-style number that’s actually largely squid’s ink. Each item is not just a surprise, but a nice surprise too. And the meal hasn’t really begun yet.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-06-2013/story-se1/|What’s remarkable is that almost everything that follows similarly twins interesting presentation, often a real delight to the eye, with surprisingly good taste and texture. So often, experimental cooking is code for ‘not actually very nice’, but here the position is precisely the opposite – everything is very nice. Almost every dish you could eat again. That’s rare enough in any multi-course meal, and perhaps even rarer where, as here, the dishes aren’t in an entirely known and usual mould. In fact, the only thing we didn’t like from six courses was one of the dishes which make up the ‘Three Bears’ porridge’ – pretty much everything else was a triumph.

Yau (currently launching the Bangkok-styled Naamyaa Café in Islington) has a knack of not offering just really good food, but an atmosphere that’s often characterised as ‘sexy’. He famously pulled off this trick at Hakkasan, and – at a lower price point – at Busaba Eathai too. This new establishment, surely,  would carry his spirit on, offering not just the refined cuisine of Kyoto, but also a good dose of slick style.

So far so good. Second impression: what happened to sexy? The bar is Japanese as if conceived by Scandinavians; it had no atmosphere at all when we swung by for a pre-lunch drink. Indeed, it was quite difficult to imagine how it ever could. Even for a business rendezvous, it seemed a cold and vacant space.

This was one of those lunches where, half way through, one of us asked if anyone had really tasted anything, and the answer from the rest of the party was a pretty consistent ‘not really’. The only thing we can remember from the box was a superb lobster claw. The disparity between the effort which had gone into presentation, and the results on the taste front was overwhelming.

Two of us then eschewed the meatier main course options, preferring to share half a dozen small plates between us. And a very convivial lunch it was, even with just a modest glass of wine apiece. Nothing was trying too hard, everything was enjoyable, and some dishes – such as scallops in filo pastry with harrissa mayo – were really very good. Surprise highlight, though, was a notably light pear and almond tart.

But you do feel as though you are boldly going where no one has been before, when you enter central(ish) London’s last major bit of in-fill development. It’s hard to find: the easiest way is to start at Paddington station’s Heathrow platform, and to follow the signs to ‘Marks & Spencer’ (whose new HQ is the development’s anchor tenant).

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-09-2012/bubbledogs-w1/|A small neon sign above an unimposing street frontage announces the name of this discreet newcomer. Might we be in Greenwich Village? Er, no – it’s Fitzrovia. The feeling of dislocation increases as, having gone down the small entrance corridor, we approach the actual dining room. It’s full of people, almost all of the same age (25-35), many standing, most drinking champagne. Just after noon.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-09-2012/bubbledogs-w1/|A corporate party? Someone filming a homage to Sex and the City? Was our journey therefore in vain? Turns out not: we could be squeezed into the last available ‘space’ (by a shelf, pictured); this is just a normal day at a newcomer which has captured the imagination of the local media-world worker bees with a bizarrely improbable formula billed as ‘hot dogs and champagne’.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-09-2012/bubbledogs-w1/|Can it really mean that? Well, the hot dog bit is true enough. Three sorts of sausage (beef, pork, veggie) come about a dozen different ways. The one we tried – a Fourth of July seemed appropriate – was certainly tasty enough (if perhaps not of any great character), and we had it with some very good tater tots (potato croquettes), which is one of the tiny range of accompaniments. No puds (yet). No coffee.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-09-2012/bubbledogs-w1/|And the drink they push really is champagne. Our glass of Gaston Chiquet – the same one they pour at Sheekey’s – was £6.50. There’s a wide choice of other ‘grower’ champagnes, as they call them, too plus – and here the hype does give way to reality a bit – a range of not inexpensive still wines and beers too.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-09-2012/bubbledogs-w1/|Notwithstanding this basic failure, does the formula seem to work? Well, it certainly seemed to be keeping the punters happy on our lunchtime visit. But a younger colleague, a New Yorker, who subsequently went on a Saturday evening, found the hot dog too bland and well-mannered, and the appeal of the overall formula difficult to see.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-09-2012/bubbledogs-w1/|Perhaps, then, this really is one of those, mercifully quite rare, reviews where the only answer is recommend you go and see for yourself. It’s not  a huge investment – a glass of champagne, a hot dog and a basket of tots weighs in at a fraction under £20.

At the entrance, hes created a classic Art Deco cocktail bar, which makes a knockout initial impression. You then pass by a luxurious suite of private dining rooms. After all this build-up, the dining room itself is a big let-down. If the lighting had been better, perhaps it wouldnt have felt just one step up from Chinatown. It doesnt help that the seats and banquettes are not especially comfortable.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w1/china-tang-dorchester-hotel.htm|The lunchtime menu is mainly dim sum, of a quality varying from good to very good. Dishes by their nature are not large, but the prices (typically £4-£10) are such that you could have a light lunch here quite reasonably. Beware, though. When we asked for a couple of extra dishes, the waiter  - without asking if it was OK - raided the top end of the menu to bring us suckling pig (£16) and rather boring salt-baked chicken (£26). Including the 12.5% service, this puffed the bill up from around £130 for three (which would have been good value) to £180 (which wasnt).

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/19-07-2010/paramount-wc1/|To visit the landmark which is Centre Point is to be taken back to a different, poorer London. The building (completed in ’66) may at the time have been perceived as a sign of thrusting optimism, but today’s visitor’s immediate impression is how poor the building ‘spec’ was compared to what we accept as the norm today. Call that sad little thing an entrance? Where’s the atrium?

Did you know that, back in the ’60s, they apparently regarded emulsion (paint!) as an acceptable wall finishing, even in ‘prestige’ projects?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/19-07-2010/paramount-wc1/|Even dolled up for its new life as a restaurant (having recently been a club), this is still a plain space, with plain décor and plain (and very ’60s-looking) furniture. If this has been the original executive lounge after the construction of the building – we know it wasn’t, as the building famously remained vacant for many years – one imagines that this is just how it might have felt. (Compare with Madison Avenue – as recently depicted in ‘Mad Men’ – and you can see just how much more comfortable ’60s office life must have been in New York than it was in London.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/19-07-2010/paramount-wc1/|Whereas the dining room, however, could convincingly pass for ’60s in a movie, the view could not. The vista here – of the ‘new’ City, and Canary Wharf in full panoply – is ‘up there’ with the one from Galvin at Windows. It makes a great setting for a business lunch.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/19-07-2010/paramount-wc1/|Indeed, the place seems all the more practical as a business lunch venue because the lack of fuss that surround the whole operation is entirely in keeping with the décor. The service is pleasant, and efficient enough, but devoid of pretensions, and the food is likewise.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/19-07-2010/paramount-wc1/|Our entirely straightforward lunch included a chicken salad (which, for those of us of a certain age,was a bit too reminiscent of what we used to see on mum’s Robert Carrier cookery course cards), a decent soup, an excellent pork chop and a reasonable bit of skate.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-07-2006/gilgamesh-nw1/|‘Wow!’ is a word that easily springs to mind as you enter this vast newcomer, in the offbeat location of Camden Market. You don’t need to have read the press release about the 500 covers, the 10,000-strong Indian design team, or the longest bar in the world (hand-carved from Lapis stone) to realise that someone has just dropped shed-loads of cash creating this place.

Down one side, a glass curtain-wall looks – bizarrely – onto a heavy good line (with the odd passing freight train for added amusement). Do we sound impressed? We were! And also by the affable service. Inevitably, though, the sensation is of eating in a huge venue or nightclub rather than a restaurant – something the huge bar and prominent DJ did nothing to dispel.

But you do feel as though you are boldly going where no one has been before, when you enter central(ish) Londons last major bit of in-fill development. Its hard to find: the easiest way is to start at Paddington stations Heathrow platform, and to follow the signs to Marks & Spencer (whose new HQ is the developments anchor tenant).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w2/pearl-liang.htm|Once youre there, this canalside development is, in an Americanised kind of way, surprisingly attractive  given that its dominated by a flyover (the Westway). It helps that the landlords - no doubt with lavish incentives - have attracted a critical mass of restaurants, including an already-popular Japanese (Yakitoria), an airy gastropub (The Union), a soon-to-open fish specialist, and the Chinese restaurant we review today.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w2/pearl-liang.htm|The rambling dining room occupies a lower level of the development. Its short on natural light, and the designers have run with a sort of opium-den chic. The overall effect is comfortable, even if the chair/table heights/depths dont quite work, and the acoustics are tricky. While were on negatives, the service does not make up in efficiency what it lacks in charm.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w2/pearl-liang.htm|The food, though, is a redeeming feature. Dim sum are a speciality (served lunch and dinner), and come at a prices reminiscent of Chinatown, and up to the same standards as the best operators there. Larger dishes - such as Peking Duck and steamed sea bass - were also realised to a superior standard. Puddings included an oddly satisfying, blue blancmange-y number. In fact, everything was consistently above par.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/10-cases-wc2/|The idea sounds so attractive. A bistro named after its ever-changing wine selection: ten whites and ten reds, all bought in (at most) ten case parcels. Offer straightforward food to go with it, and serve it in a cramped and decidedly no-nonsense setting handy for, say, the Royal Opera House. Et voilÃ !
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/10-cases-wc2/|Well, not quite: we found the reality less compelling. Let’s start with the ‘marquee attraction’: the wine list. There’s just one house champagne, from a little producer called’ Moët & Chandon. Wouldn’t your typical oenophile hope to be introduced to some marque rather less grande than the world’s biggest fizz? It seemed an odd start.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/10-cases-wc2/|Rather similarly, the list of still wines seemed disappointingly straightforward for a place that plays on its wine appeal. But the main impression was how expensive the wines were by the glass.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/10-cases-wc2/|Surely the joy of a place like this is to sample? Yet 1/6-bottle glasses of wine are generally priced somewhere round one third the price of a full bottle. Why a premium approaching 100% for samplers? And if you’re going to offer just one dessert wine, should it be a Sauternes at £10 a glass?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/10-cases-wc2/|The blackboard menu is short to the point of brutal. Three main courses always available, and a changing, but very small, selection of more transient plats, most so straightforward that their description requires no more than a couple of words. Puddings were tarts – pear or lemon?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/10-cases-wc2/|It makes perfect sense for a small kitchen to do a few things well, but results here were variable. Starting at the end, with those tarts, the one we chose (pear, as it happens) was dull and a bit flabby.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/10-cases-wc2/|Earlier dishes had their highs and lows. The house salad – a warm affair with pancetta and a duck’s egg on top – was described by a guest as a ‘warm mush’. A tranche of salmon, however, was unusually well cooked – evenly all through, which is no easy feat. A chicken terrine was straightforward, and none the worse for that.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/10-cases-wc2/|Bread was pretty horrible. Hardly surprising: baguettes in London are almost always like cotton wool. But this isn’t a French restaurant. Why not give people the best local-style bread? Or, in London, pain rustique is invariably a better choice. The coffee was unremarkable too.

We can’t remember precisely what they consisted of, but they certainly added interest! A duck leg from the set lunch menu was precisely cooked, the meat falling from the bone but not at all overcooked.

Reviewing this ambitious-looking new Clerkenwell venture – which prominently advertises its ‘Thai-Indian cuisine’ – therefore looked set to be a cinch.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-04-2006/cardamom-rooms-ec1/|My old friend obligingly set about ordering a Thai set lunch to complement my Indian one. I began to congratulate myself on how easily the column was to be filled up with descriptions of the varying national styles of dishes (interspersed with the occasional insightful point of comparison between the two).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-04-2006/cardamom-rooms-ec1/|But it was not to be. Those enticed in by the prominently advertised Thai set lunch (or, indeed, the Ã  la carte) are told – without much in the way of apology, or explanation – that Thai cuisine is now ‘off’. For good, it seems. So this performance, it turned out, was to be Hamlet very much without the Prince.

In fact, remove the Thai ‘angle’, and what’s left is a pretty unremarkable Indian restaurant, of the type which continues to colonise many environs of the City. The cooking – rather at the level you might have expected if the kitchen had been struggling to cope with two great cuisines at once  – seemed undistinguished for a brigade that now only needs concern itself with one. The service was fine, if not especially engaging, but looked as if it might get rather over-stretched as the place filled up.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2009/aqua-kyoto-w1/|Intrigued by our recent visit to the neighbouring Spanish restaurant, aqua nueva, we felt the need to hot-foot back across town to see how the neighbouring Japanese restaurant had turned out. There’s not much point in us setting the scene again, so if you haven’t read that
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2009/aqua-kyoto-w1/|Our early lunching experience of the Japanese operation was just like the Spanish one: perfectly competent, but nothing to get excited about (if with perhaps a bit more atmosphere here). The details hardly matter, though, as the key point is that it was pretty much empty; the sort of empty that makes you feel sorry for the staff (who were charming, and trying hard). And, if anything, the Spanish part, which we revisited, was even emptier than it had been on our first visit.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2009/aqua-kyoto-w1/|Causes are not hard to find. The absurdly discreet entrance doesn’t look like a restaurant at all: even a nightclub like Annabel’s is less of a shrinking violet than this place is. There is no menu outside – isn’t that illegal anyway? And why, when so many restaurants which don’t need doormen have them nowadays, does this place – which desperately does – not have two? (Hey, one in Spanish dress, one Japanese – at least they’d be noticed.) If you do summon up the courage to go in, the Stygian ground floor lobby feels positively spooky. We were half way across the apparently deserted room when a voice demanded to know our business. Well, to go to the restaurant; the lifts from the lobby go nowhere else.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2009/aqua-kyoto-w1/|The whole approach is so wrong that it makes you wonder how anyone – even more a highly regarded international operator with a number of outlets in the East – can spend millions, and still not have thought properly about the basics of getting people into such an obscurely-located restaurant in the first place. We’re told that measures are in hand to put right many of the most obvious defects. But is there time? Without the mother of all relaunches, this place is fast beginning to look like the biggest pre-Christmas turkey London has ever seen.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/23-03-2016/discover-this-weeks-top-5-trending-london-restaurants-13/|You’ve probably noticed on Twitter on the left hand side of your ‘Home’ page there’s a ‘Trends’ list. Twizoo has built the same thing, but solely for London restaurants. Our number crunching detects the rate of change of influential mentions on Twitter. For example, ‘Christmas’ is currently trending on Twitter, which means there’s been a spike of mentioning Christmas now compared with the rest of the year.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/23-03-2016/discover-this-weeks-top-5-trending-london-restaurants-13/|Applying this to Twizoo’s algorithms: if X restaurant usually gets on average 10 tweets per week, but this week it gets 32 tweets… that’s a pretty big change, so it’s a good indicator something notable is going on. The algorithm notes restaurants that have the highest rate of change and ranks them based on which places’ tweets are the most positive collectively and then it takes the top of those based on how influential the individuals are who tweeted. Simple see?

(Hey, one in Spanish dress, one Japanese - at least theyd be noticed.) If you do summon up the courage to go in, the Stygian ground floor lobby feels positively spooky. We were half way across the apparently deserted room when a voice demanded to know our business. Well, to go to the restaurant; the lifts from the lobby go nowhere else.

Some felt that we were cruel to suggest a system that would deprive hard-working and underpaid waiters of much-needed income. Well, just look at the example Mr Meyer is setting in New York. Instead of supplementing his employees’ income with gratuity, he’s offering to pay them a fair wage from the outset. The initiative titled ‘Hospitality Included’ will also see an increase in prices and a shift towards a European-style system where menu prices will be all-inclusive. Roll-out across his 13-strong NYC restaurant empire begins in November.
