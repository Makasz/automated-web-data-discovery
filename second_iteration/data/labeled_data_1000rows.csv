It makes a great kebab, an excellent burger, it can be a meatball.|restaurants
I know you don’t need to have an excuse to have a Bubbly Brunch but when you have crisp fluffy smoked salmon waffles beside your gorgeous glass of aged cava, I don’t see how you can resist.|restaurants
Cava is an excellent wine choice|restaurants
As with champagne, it is made in the traditional method and it is fermented and aged in bottle leading to some excellent wines.|restaurants
Cava has a DO (denomination of origin) which means that it can only be made in specific areas, although 95% of cava is made in Penedès in Catalonia|restaurants
Cava is made primarily with indigenous Spanish grapes, Macabeo, Parellada and Xarel·lo|restaurants
Other grapes like chardonnay are also added at times.|restaurants
Cava can be white or rosé and as part of the traditional method cava has two fermentations, the second being in bottle where it can also be aged. Reserva, Gran Reserva and Cava de Paraje wines are all aged high quality cava wines which you can enjoy in some terrific Spanish tapas bars and restaurants across the UK this week.|restaurants
A heads up for you that my residency at fabulous Irish cocktail bar in Islington, Homeboy, is coming to a close this weekend|restaurants
Do come, there are only 3 more days and 4 services:|restaurants

Services are long and really tiring|restaurants
I have never done so much wash up! I have been running the kitchen solo, cook and KP.|restaurants
It has been 6 weeks since I started and it has been a lot of fun and it has been really wonderful to meet many of you and feed you! Now, I need to get back to my desk|restaurants
I adore cooking but I miss writing, and I need to publish that book, Bacon, now.|restaurants

Brief recap! Parma Ham is one of those products where you are gifted instant flavour, the work all being done by the producer before it hits your plate|restaurants
It is preservative free, being just Pork + Air + Salt + Time and lessons learned from history and generations of prior producers|restaurants
Parma Ham plays well with others and gifts instant depth of flavour to many things|restaurants
It makes a lovely crisp jacket when you wrap other things in it, whether that is a bundle of green beans or asparagus, a lovely piece of fish or in this case pork belly.|restaurants
My pork belly obsession is well documented|restaurants
It is a perfect roast, yes, especially when you roast it slow|restaurants
It is brilliantly flexible beyond this though|restaurants
I have taken to cooking smaller amounts of pork belly quicker with excellent results|restaurants
This Parma Ham wrapped pork belly is a perfect example and it is so good|restaurants
The ham keeps all the pork belly juices inside as it cooks, and gives it an extra deeply savoury layer.|restaurants
On the side, as much as I love the humble spud and a slick plate of mash, I go for beans here|restaurants
Beans also make great mash and they are especially nice for summer or Autumn|restaurants
I like to use a plump butter bean (or better yet, Greek gigantes beans)|restaurants
Not only do they make a delicious mash, they make an instant one too|restaurants
Protein rich with a hint of garlic and savouriness of rosemary|restaurants
Those roasting juices from the pork belly wrapped with Parma Ham are sublime and elevate everything.|restaurants
You can of course use a favourite chilli oil or one that you have at home|restaurants
I provide a recipe for a simple one here flavoured with garlic and chilli|restaurants
Play around, make a peppercorn oil, add herbs as it cools down (not at the beginning or they will burn)|restaurants
Homemade oils bring brilliant flavour|restaurants
If you don’t want chilli make a simple herb oil by blending a flavourful herb (like oregano or basil) with some oil, allowing it to infuse and then pass it through a coffee filter or similar and you are good to go.|restaurants
A ham sangwich (correct spelling!) was the frequent snack of many an Irish childhood|restaurants
Especially at my Grandmothers when we would visit on St Stephen’s Day (aka Boxing Day)|restaurants
I knew that I would have to eat that ham in order to access some biscuits|restaurants
As with most things, it was beautiful in its simplicity|restaurants
Thick sliced bread, butter, home cooked ham, done.|restaurants
My rural Irish childhood involved only Irish ham (which is of course very good)|restaurants
It was often home-cooked, thickly sliced, and sometimes pulled directly from the ham by my tiny enthusiastic hands|restaurants
When I moved from rural Ireland to Cork city, I discovered a wonderful Italian deli (Iago’s), where I would become a regular|Iago’s
It was there that I discovered the joys of Parma Ham|restaurants
I went through a phase of wrapping everything in it, and I still do sometimes today|restaurants
I especially love it as a satisfying meaty snack for moments requiring instant gratification.|restaurants
Parma, the home of Parma Ham (and Parmiggiano Reggiano), is a small city in Emilia Romagna in Northern Italy|restaurants
Emilia Romagna has a sublime food culture|restaurants
Described as the belly of Italy (which gives some clue as to just how well you will eat there), Emilia Romagna is one of my most visited places (along with Rome)|restaurants
It is the home of many things, including my favourite|restaurants
and that gorgeous and very underrated wine, Lambrusco|restaurants
Parma itself is a joy of a place to walk around with its winding streets lined by tall brightly painted old buildings.|restaurants
Tofu! Now some of you are going to read that and think, WHAT?! TOFU?! Yes, tofu|restaurants
Why? It is horribly underrated and completely delicious|restaurants
Once you get the real thing|restaurants
Tofu is thought of as a vegetarian or vegan ingredient, and yes it is, but in Asia it is as common to see it in a dish with meat, as not|restaurants
See my recipe for|restaurants
Tofu is also a fast food|restaurants
The fastest, it is already good to go|restaurants
It soaks up flavours and loves contrasting textures|restaurants
I love it in a crispy fritter for brunch as much as I do in a stew|restaurants
I love proper silken tofu, fresh from fridges of Asian food shops (especially Japanese)|restaurants
Silken is a joy, the very good stuff has the texture of custard|restaurants
All of it is sublime when fried, and I have fried tofu every which way|restaurants
A firm – nay, wobbly – favourite is Agedashi Tofu.|restaurants
A Japanese delight of a dish, age-dashi means fry-dashi and that is what this is, fried tofu with a seasoned dashi broth|restaurants
Seasoned with soy and mirin (you can use sake too)|restaurants
It is naturally gluten free, usually using potato starch or corn starch|restaurants
I love to use potato starch for this, it confers a stretchy crispness which is perfect with the wobbly tofu underneath|restaurants
I sometimes mix the potato starch with rice flour, and of course you can just use rice flour too which will give a lovely crisp coating.|restaurants
Well I am excited and nervous in equal amounts|restaurants
My second book BACON is going to print in September to be delivered in plenty of time for Christmas|restaurants
For you early birds there is an early bird offer that runs only until Monday (|restaurants
If you want a copy, you need to act now|restaurants
This will be a limited edition release and there is only going to be one small print run this year limited to 1000 books|restaurants
I will be stuffing the envelopes myself – and of course, signing every copy! – and with 800 already sold that pretty much sorts my November! My priority is to deliver the book to my wonderful original backers, and also to print additional copies for readers who may have missed that opportunity or joined the fold since then.|restaurants
With the exception of a handful of recipes that were in my Sunday Bacon Club and Bacon Masterclasses, these are all spanking NEW! None of the recipes exist elsewhere and if you love bacon you must have it|restaurants
If you love to eat generally|restaurants
Bacon is the focus but not always dominant|restaurants
Sometimes it is!|restaurants
Hake is a beauty of a fish that is so underappreciated|restaurants
We love it in Ireland, the Spanish love it too|restaurants
In a way, I am glad that it isn’t hugely popular here as it makes it quite affordable|restaurants
That big piece of hake in the photo came in at under £5 in an excellent but expensive London fishmonger|restaurants
It flakes gently and has a beautiful light flavour|restaurants
It works very well with big things like chorizo but it also plays well with gentler things like these summery beans.|restaurants
That brisk sea breeze off the Bay of Fundy is enough to clear all cobwebs and signs of jet lag|restaurants
I was up early the next day and on my way|restaurants
Headed to Saint Andrews by the Sea with a pit stop by the beach, and for some fried clams|Saint Andrews by the Sea
It can be hard to get me out of my bed in the morning especially with jet lag, but not when there is an early lunch of fried clams on the immediate horizon.|restaurants
About a half hour drive out of Saint John lies New River Beach|restaurants
A gorgeous stretch of coastline, all sandy beach and bright blue ocean and sky|restaurants
A paddle in the ocean before a feed of fried clams (and other gorgeous fried things) is a joyful thing|restaurants
The clams were at Ossie’s Lunch|Ossie’s Lunch
A small diner at the side of the road with lots of picnic tables where you can tuck in outside.|restaurants
Entering its 61st season, Ossie’s Lunch was opened in 1957 by Osborne and Roseanna Waite and is still going strong under new owner Shawn Saulnier|Ossie’s Lunch
Roseanna still works there on occasion, as does her daughter Angela|restaurants
You probably don’t know – I didn’t – that New Brunswickers LOVE fried clams and places like Ossie’s Lunch are packed on public holidays and in season.|restaurants
For the second part of my Vorarlberg stay, we moved to Bregenzerwald|restaurants
The drive to Bregenzerwald from Lech is a magical weave through valleys and mountains|restaurants
Sweeping winding roads, and lots of promise|restaurants
So stunning we had to stop to take some photos and stop and pause to take it all in.|restaurants
|restaurants
A beautiful restaurant in an old house with one of those beautiful large tiled heaters (a Kachelofen)|restaurants
Windows draped by small curtains looked at the mountains outside|restaurants
We took a table in the corner and perused the traditional menu|restaurants
I love the menus in places like this|restaurants
Plump käsespätzle (handmade noodle shreds in a voluptuous and generous cheese sauce) and schnitzel were what drew most of us in|restaurants
The cool mountain air creates an enthusiastic appetite and with a distillery trip straight after, there is a need for it.|restaurants
I am fond of winter but I love to see it go|restaurants
By the time it leaves it has become an unwelcome guest|restaurants
It is a relief to see the buds open at Springtime and the trees begin to flourish, as they are this week|restaurants
Walks home from the supermarket are peppered with mini assaults of blossom fragrance|restaurants
The footpaths are dusted with their petals|restaurants
The days are longer, the sky brighter, there is the promise of summer to come|restaurants
Food becomes more interesting as we are almost out of the Hungry Gap (that period when little grows).|restaurants
Mountains come into their own in Spring and Summer|restaurants
No more so than those favoured for their winter culture like the Alps|restaurants
Last summer I visited Vorarlberg in the Austrian Alps|restaurants
Our drive from Zürich ascended in the dark, in the morning I was greeted with crisp air, the sights of lush meadows and tall peaks, and bubbling brooks.|restaurants
The town of Lech is a pretty one|restaurants
Famed for royal visitors (Princess Diana would ski here), it is also one of the worlds premier ski destinations|restaurants
But Lech is also a joy in summer|restaurants
The crowds are gone, and in the place of the snow all is lush|restaurants
The days are hot and long, but there is crisp clear air accompanying.|restaurants
I know everything should start with an onion, or so the saying goes|restaurants
Most of my cooking does|restaurants
But not always|restaurants
Sometimes just garlic will do and occasionally not at all|restaurants
When I made this dish I started with minced beef not sure of what I would add next|restaurants
The final result was a tasty speedy supper that required little work or preparation|restaurants
I call that a winner!|restaurants
I am a regular visitor to Canada|restaurants
I love the vast expanse of it|restaurants
The people, the calm, the lakes and forests, the cities with the quickly expanding and inspiring culinary scene|restaurants
Excellent cocktails, terrific Canadian wines, a booming craft booze scene and lovely restaurants and bars to sample them|restaurants
Canada is an excellent place for a road trip, especially a culinary one.|restaurants
New Brunswick was the scene of my most recent Culinary Road Trip, packed with snow crab and lobster, lush produce from the farmlands and foraged seaweeds and sea greens from the seashore|restaurants
It is one of four of Canada’s Atlantic provinces on the east coast|restaurants
83% of New Brunswick is under forest, and the cities are small by international standards|restaurants
It is a perfect relaxed spot for a break and to unwind. I flew into Saint John via Halifax, Nova Scotia|restaurants
A short flight in a small plane with excellent views of the landscape below brought me to Canada’s oldest incorporated city|restaurants
I started my culinary road trip here.|restaurants
New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province in Canada with English and French being commonly spoken|restaurants
The indigenous population has been established there since 7000BC (at the time of European contact these included the Mi’kmaq, the Maliseet, and the Passamaquoddy)|restaurants
Populations arrived from Europe from the 1600s included French, British and Irish|restaurants
The city of Miramichi claims to be the Irish capital of Canada and was one of the points of arrival for many of Ireland’s coffin ships during the famine|restaurants
It is home to a large Irish Festival now every year|restaurants
New Brunswick was almost called New Ireland at one point until it was vetoed by King George III|restaurants
Which, of course it was.|restaurants
I cooked this at a supper club for 30 people recently|restaurants
The fourth course of five – all containing black pudding – and as much as I love this dish, I fully did not expect every plate to come back clean|restaurants
But they did! And so I think we can all agree that it is a winner|restaurants
They told me so too.|restaurants
You see the thing is when so many of your days revolve around cooking and you are generally the only person eating it, it becomes easy to question every bite and wonder if it is enough|restaurants
Should it be more, bigger, brighter? Everyone who works alone has this problem in one way or another|restaurants
It would be perfect to have someone to bounce things off, a recipe tester, a friend|restaurants
A room full of 30 people eating your food with enthusiasm? Perfection.|restaurants
, no other meat|restaurants
It is a popular recipe on here, called (tongue in cheek) Corkese|restaurants
I use Irish black pudding and would suggest that you seek it out for this too|restaurants
It has a different texture to British black pudding, made with oats and spices, it crumbles and almost bursts when you roast it.|restaurants
The more that I cook, the more I desire simplicity|restaurants
Fresh bright flavours delivered without fuss and with speed|restaurants
Food that is healthy and bright.|restaurants
There was a time when I would devote much of my evening to delivering the meal that I would eat, often too late|restaurants
Increasingly my cooking becomes simpler, fitted into tighter timeframes|restaurants
I desire food that is fast and that delivers on flavour and that will sustain me too|restaurants
Food that is healthy and balanced and that changes day to day. This way I always enjoy it, and my nutritional intake is varied too.|restaurants
I generally cook for one but I usually cook enough for two meals each time|restaurants
Borrowing time from the night before for the next day|restaurants
Leftovers are terrific and the second iteration will usually have a twist so that it is different|restaurants
This didn’t|restaurants
I loved it so much the first time I kept it the same.|restaurants
Today is Pancake Tuesday / Shrove Tuesday / Mardi Gras|restaurants
What a happy eating day! Mardi Gras means Fat Tuesday, the day to clear your cupboards before 40 days of Lenten fast. Every day can be pancake day but Pancake Tuesday is the one|restaurants
I have gathered my favourite pancake recipes for you|restaurants
Get stuck in.|restaurants
These dal pancakes were originally made with leftover dal but you should absolutely cook up a batch to make them|restaurants
They are a cracker and enlivened with the gorgeous aromas from the crisped curry leaves and the punch of bright chilli oil.|restaurants
We live in the age of the multi cooker|restaurants
Many modern kitchens have one small appliance that does many jobs, and it isn’t your stove|restaurants
The latest to launch in the UK comes from Ninja Kitchen,|Ninja Kitchen
, and in a state when Tom decided to leave the restaurant (and London) in the Summer of 2018|restaurants
For a brief moment, he transferred head cheffing duties to his old sous,|restaurants
, which was absolutely the right choice as he ran shop like a bomb with Charlotte at FOH|restaurants
Unfortunately the new owners at Bonhams had a change of heart and rather abruptly decided to shut the restaurant at the end of 2018|Bonhams
Only to have another change of heart, to (puzzlingly) put in something apparently trendy (at least it isnt skewers and sandwiches, I suppose), less ambitious and in the process had consciously dumped one of the few worthy michelin restaurants in London that practiced proper classic technique and bought in whole fish and poultry.|restaurants
Will Lander and the Portland crew have now recently settled in for their little Italian bistro, and while i like my tortelini il brodo, I wish Will and Dan all the best with their latest gig of course, but I will now turn my attention to Horsham (of all places), as that is where the great Tom Kemble has decided to take the next step in his culinary game.|Horsham
Some of you will know the hotel, South Lodge belonging to a group of country hotels with capable chefs attached, such as Matt Worswick at The Latymer|The Latymer
While others will no doubt have visited The Pass at Southlodge, when it was run by Matt Gillan, formerly of GBM fame and also recipient of a michelin star.|The Pass
Tom inherits Matt’s old digs, its USP being the relative borderless gap between the diners sitting on high table top banquettes and the kitchen, separated by carefully placed glass panels (installed by Tom and co).|restaurants
Having started here since the start of 2019, he has settled in with the new kitchen, new team and rather refreshingly his cuisine is now evolving, or more precisely, left unshackled by Bonhams’ rather conservative clientele tastes|Bonhams
He is now more freely injecting his wholly minimalist style with touches of Japanese methods, as well as developing new cooking techniques which were otherwise impossible in the Bonhams basement kitchen.|Bonhams
Product quality and insistence on a la minute cooking is still the focus of his cuisine, to this point, since Tom is now closer to the South coast, he’s taking full advantage of this by sourcing from relative proximity – seabass and scallops being two examples.|restaurants
At Bonhams, there was always the careful preservation of natural flavours, today, he layers with a sleuth of rice vinegars, dashis and other layers of flavours to progress the overall delivery of his dishes|Bonhams
One other fundamental new string that Tom has incorporated in his repertoire is premium smoke in the form of a new konro grill that takes binchotan|restaurants
He showed us a few dishes, of the ones that stood out for me, were the oyster with smoked Chantilly cream as well as the lobster – cooked in shell to a perfect mi-cuit centre, and imbued with a very subtle lacing of smoke|restaurants
Lovely cuisson, but it gets better as he matches the lobster with a heart racing bone-marrow and madeira sauce – Tom’s idea of a surf and turf.|restaurants
To finish, Tom demos his latest pudding developments, a homage to Stephen Harris’ much loved chocolate mousse|restaurants
Tom extrapolates the chaud-froid effect with a super clean milk sorbet, passionfruit gel and pump street chocolate thats been fried to a crispy sub-cooled temperature by liquid nitrogen (which he also inherits from Matt G)|restaurants
As with The Sportsman, the warm chocolate mousse is very light, as it is pushed through a whipper.|restaurants
Coffee is by Difference Coffee, Tom is offering either the stock beans or blue mountain (though I personally like the Hawaiian stuff), and caviar is Attilus, just like at The Latymer|he Latymer
Wine will take some time to come along as its part of the Hotel’s charge, but all in all, it is very exciting.|restaurants
If you are like me, and have also enjoyed his restraint cooking at Bonhams, I recommend popping down to Horsham to give the new Kembler a spin|Bonhams, Horsham
The man is excited in his new kitchen and has furiously developed his cuisine|restaurants
He does taster menus at three price points, £50 , £70, £90pp|restaurants
We opted for a longer carte blanche and was charged £120pp + drinks + service for the meal.|restaurants
I loved this|restaurants
It appears simple but the whole is certainly greater than the sum of its constituent parts|restaurants
He’s basically assembled ocean minerals of the oyster, caviar and plankton, to contrast with the plushness of the chantilly having taken up the essence of binchotan|restaurants
Smoke has the effect of deepening flavours, both savoury and the sweetness of the oyster.|restaurants
Seamless, silk smooth and perfectly delicate savoury custard, served warm and at the start of the meal (which is how I prefer it)|restaurants
We have indeed arrived at the craftsman Tom Kemble’s new digs.|restaurants
Having eaten a number of his various chawanmushi in Bonhams days, I thought I knew his cuisine well, but that’s when he surprised me with this sweet vinegar pickle on the shiitake, taking the umami elevator to the next level|restaurants
The guiding principle of simplicity is still ever present, but the flavour layerings have evolved from the nascent|restaurants
3|restaurants
Devon scallop sashimi, Piemontese hazelnut, rock samphire, and an incredible sauce made from blood orange, tomato, sake, olive oil, amongst other things.|restaurants
Tom has now swapped Isle of Mull for fish from the South Coast, taking advantage of the relative geography|restaurants
The scallops were spanking quality|restaurants
As some of you will have experienced elsewhere, live scallops are very taut and almost crunchy in texture, and is notable for being incredibly sweet.|restaurants
Tom reckons his bao dough is work in progress, but I loved it|restaurants
With devon smoked eel brushed with tare over coals, and served with Granny Smith and kohlrabi.|restaurants
Grilled over binchotan to a glassy skin, and carefully to allow heat to slowly travel up the fillet|restaurants
Rested to a medium centre, it cuts cleanly in half after cooking.|restaurants
(ex-Umu, think Unagi)|restaurants
Monks beard for texture, and an electric beurre blanc made la minute, with pickled dulse, harmonising to great effect with the grilled fish|restaurants
Craft aside, it’s incredibly delicious|restaurants
Wiped the plate dry with bread.|restaurants
Sussex blues, killed and halved la minute, skewered and then low and slow in shell|restaurants
To plate, it is shelled and quartered length wise, aiguillettes in the flair of Alain Passard|restaurants
Spot on cook to uniform and beautifully glistening mi-cuit (swipe 👉)|restaurants
The bincho subtly infused, provided a rush of smoke, without masking the naturally sweet and taut lobster tail|restaurants
The noble shellfish is right at the start of its season here|restaurants
Claws were also smoked over coals, and then briefly steamed prior to plating|restaurants
Tom’s favourite endives provide respite from the flavour bombs, meanwhile the maitake, meaty and a bridge to the rim rocking sauce.|restaurants
The turf part of this surf and turf – diced bone marrow – has amazing gastrique qualities, the madeira, red rice vinegar, providing sweet and sour, meanwhile the bone marrow are globules of flavour that melt on the palate|restaurants
Layers of underlying deepness in this jus, or a jus gras when spread on the plate with presumably the oils from the marrow splitting it|restaurants
A revelation of a sauce.|restaurants
, he had done them out of shell in a pan and cut it with an emulsion of its own coral and blood peach – a pure dish of peak summer flavours|restaurants
Here, Tom has progressed his thought process, adding latitude and dimension, whilst still keeping the palate clean|restaurants
Masterpiece|restaurants
Completely sexy dish|restaurants

Herdwick lamb classically pan roasted, binchotan roasted aubergine and prepared like baba ganoush, komatsuna, black garlic and jus gras|restaurants
For mains, Tom showed a classic combo lamb and aubergines, which blurred the lines in melding of classic technique with Mediterranean and Japanese influences|restaurants
Where in the past at Bonhams, he had kept things minimal and flavours classic (with his salt marsh lamb in July onwards), here he has stepped up intensity and complexity, layering up the umami and balancing with the coolness of the yoghurt|Bonhams
Ultimately it’s a dish that embraces flavour, and was satisfying way to end the savouries|restaurants
I prefer my lamb on the bone of course, but the extra piece of lamb belly on skewers made up for the lost bone gnawing|restaurants
They were banging.|restaurants
Herdwick hogget aged for 1 week in salt chambers|restaurants
Racks have been classically roasted and taken off the bone to medium rare and fat cap on, it sits on black garlic puree, that’s been let down in some sake and mirin|restaurants
Meanwhile the belly is confit, rubbed with a mint sauce, extra belly skewered on the side|restaurants
Really tasty, even two wasn’t enough.|restaurants
And then things gets exciting with Italian round aubergines cooked in over binchotan, then made into a baba ganoush, with mixture of aubergines pickled in rice vinegar and is finally topped with sesame seeds, and nori|restaurants
For freshness, steamed komatsuna, Neals Yard yoghurt with a vibrant oil made from kaffir lime, ginger, coriander and others|restaurants
And finally it is finished with a jus gras with big pearls of lamb fat.|restaurants
Tom Kemble at The Pass, South Lodge Horsham, Apr 19|The Pass
Hot/Cold chocolate variations with milk sorbet and passionfruit gel Tom inherited the open kitchen from Gillan’s days (still seen here while he gets his new gig going), the restaurant is relatively small, a couple steps from the banquette high tables to his pass, so there is a sense you’re almost in there|restaurants
He also inherited liquid nitrogen, nice crockery,all part of the genesis, or shall we say the presentation of it, as he summoned us to into the kitchen for pudding …and I thought i’d never see the day Kembler did modernist|restaurants
Jack is on pastry, turn it up 🔊 , you’ll hear Tom give a quick run down of the dish as Jack prepares it|restaurants
An homage to @sportsmankent Stephen Harris’ warm chocolate mousse (also iSi whipper) with milk ice cream, & ongoing development with @pumpstreetchocolate (72%Bourbon mousse) , with a very clean milk sorbet from his Bonhams days (made with creme crue, which I love)|restaurants
– Firstly, the pudding is gorgeous in its simplicity – and a very pure milk chocolate|restaurants
Chaud/froid study of contrasting temperatures, warm mousse to ice cold cream to nitro cold crumble (so to speak)|restaurants
Served in a bowl, the whole thing yields pure satisfaction – the spoon eases in smooth, snappy tuile then mousse(swipe 👉)|restaurants
I mopped it up in seconds|restaurants
A true pud|restaurants
I generally avoid a heavy chocolate, but this is notable in that you get the sinful comfort, but come away with a light finish|restaurants
Secondly, and perhaps more so, the interaction works especially well for this one|restaurants
Rather than for show, Tom’s used the nitrogen to refry the chocolate, so there is an element of la minute prep that’s integral to the eating experience|restaurants
As the dining room is so close, its easy for people to pop into the kitchen to see their pud being put together, and it totally works well as a finale to the taster menu|restaurants
Also, notice Tom casually showing off his perfect rochers, two in a row.🌟..🌟|restaurants
Hope Stephen tries this one day, I’m pretty sure he’ll be pretty happy with it|restaurants
I most certainly was|restaurants
@tfkemble @jack_robey1996 @aaronmcnamara_91 @greground1 @south_lodge #horshamrestaurants #eaterlondon @eaterlondon #lefooding #sushikemble|restaurants
So so glad to be reading your reviews and food thoughts again|restaurants
You are my absolute go-to when looking to dine in the UK and Continent., when we are able to visit from our home here in Australia.|restaurants
Scotch blue lobster, and for the base, I started simply with onions and tomatoes, garlic, softened in bit of olive oil, splash of cognac|restaurants
Then simmered in dashi, sherry vinegar, kaffir lime|restaurants
Claws and tail poached in the stock and then all the precious juices are saved and all poured back into the soup|restaurants
Shells are then toasted on a dry pan until it just starts to smoulder|restaurants
Then it is all chucked into the stock|restaurants
Topped with water on the odd occasion, only a touch of salt and then simmered for a day|restaurants
The noble shellfish’s sheer purity of natural sweetness never ceases to amaze me|restaurants
Finally it is sieved|restaurants
Touch of paprika, lemon, cream and butter, blitzed with a hand food processor, et voila, bowl of liquid joy.|restaurants
I was getting Lobsters about the same size here last year £20 for 3 (or 4 if they were slightly smaller) straight off the boat.|restaurants
Many attempts have been made to pigeon hole this restaurant ever since it stormed on to the London scene in late 2017, though none are accurate reflections of what to expect when you eventually sit down for a meal here|restaurants
Which is great, if you like surprises, of the good kind when it comes to food and I know you do because you’re still reading this.|restaurants
London has been going this way for a few years now, the heritage of Anglo-French classic craft is very much the backbone of many kitchens with serious intentions, but it is refreshing to see Chefs move away from butter and cream to embrace flavours from all over the world, guided only by what it is to make delicious food|restaurants
While it is vogue for today’s European based chefs to borrow (heavily) from the Japanese (dashis, vinegars, seaweed), Jeremy Chan has chosen an altogether different route to peak umami via Jollof cuisine|restaurants
It might be highly presumptuous of me to offer Jeremy as the modern day version of Olivier Roellinger; classic techniques with a growing knowledge of spices… though quite some way before Chan reaches Roellinger’s legend status.|restaurants
He started out in the City with a desk and quickly got up from behind it to pursue his passion in food, with his business partner and former flatmate Iré Hassan-Odukale|restaurants
Some impressive restaurants grace the 31 year old chef’s resume, stints in Hibiscus under the great Claude Bosi, then Heston’s Dinner and a stage at Rene’s mission Scandinavia temple, Noma.|restaurants
This blog post assembles two snapshots in time, set one year apart, from Spring 2018 to Spring 2019, and my thoughts on how Jeremy has rapidly developed and evolved his idea of gastronomy.|restaurants
On my first visit there, I was reasonably impressed by the quality of produce on display and set of spices which I’d not come across before|restaurants
I had wondered if these were the flavours of Nigerian cuisine, albeit dressed up for London palates, or if it was modern European accented by African spices|restaurants
Without a reference point and having never been to Africa, it was all an education for me|restaurants
My impression last year was that the spicing was a little over the top and he could perhaps pay some attention to balancing the dishes – a little salt here and a little acidity there, let’s say universal things that constitute delicious.|restaurants
Fast forward to 10th May 2019, one michelin star win later and things have certainly changed here|restaurants
First of all, Jeremy has done away with the ALC and only does blind taster menus|restaurants
If you follow their|restaurants
, you’ll see that they’ve been busy making connections with key suppliers for quality British produce and above all perhaps, the kitchen has intensified its core cuisson specifically on proteins.|restaurants
And that’s how the second meal pretty much went – perfectly cooked product one after the other, and increasing so as we worked our way up to the noble proteins|restaurants
Frankly it was a joy and somewhat of a surprise to see London chefs paying this much attention to the actual cookery of products all in a single meal, outside of the established places, Ledbury, Hedone and the Greenhouse|restaurants
The respect and love for the ingredient was clear, translating into exacting raising to the right temperatures.|restaurants
Last year I most certainly found the spices to have got in the way of the dishes, but this year however, it feels like he’s struck the right balance, spicing to enhance flavours rather than numb the palate|restaurants
These guys have not stood still, and have indeed continually developed the cuisine and refined their craft|restaurants
What a meal this was, and in London no less, with beautiful British produce|restaurants
A triumph and every bit worthy of the Michelin star that the Bib has awarded to Jeremy and team.|restaurants
Due to location, Ikoyi is most definitely not cheap, but you do get what you paid for|Ikoyi
The normal taster menu is currently £75pp, the extended normally advertised as £100pp, but my menu costed £120pp|restaurants
If in doubt, ask before you order.|restaurants
Saying all this, I wholeheartedly recommend you to give Ikoyi a spin and go with an open mind|restaurants
Leave aside any preconceived notions of what you think the cuisine here is|restaurants
For me, I think of it as Modern European with Nigerian spices and vegetables, but the terroir is most definitely British, and it makes this very much a London restaurant|restaurants
The guys have been chipping away at their little project for about 2 years now, and I think Jeremy has now begun shaping something that is both delicious and uniquely his own|restaurants
Not so easy to stand out in this realm with so much Gastronomic history already cataloged today, but Jeremy and Iré have just about pulled it off.|restaurants
This is one of the most delicious bites I’ve had this year|restaurants
If you weren’t told, you wouldn’t know it was brain at all|restaurants
This is someone who has the genius to assemble these flavours and textures together into a singular bite bursting with satisfying savouriness|restaurants
Primary tastes of salty, sweet, contrast of crispy starch and creamy sauce, it’s a smart dish, surprising, exciting, simple and unique all at the same time|restaurants
Jeremy, this is a winner|restaurants
Everybody should go and eat this in the Spring while morels are still around to savour it.|restaurants
The purée bathed in a flavour deepening smoked oil, is a little sweet, like say chocolate or perhaps sweet potato, it acts as a platform for the caviar, being the key that breathes life into the dish|restaurants
Salinity unlocking a satisfying contrast of earth and sea|restaurants
Deceptively simple, but a lot going on in the eating|restaurants
Elegant dish!|restaurants
(very good) and then Exmoor (not so good, sturgeon are more German than English if you ask me)|restaurants
He does also source from Hermes,|restaurants
which is spectacular|restaurants
Though he refrains from it, as the caviar is so good that actually best on its own|restaurants
I love N25 (their Kaluga is mindblowing), something which I tend to agree with, unless the dish itself is pretty mild in flavour, buratta perhaps.|N25
Peak condition pollack, spectacularly confit to perfection|restaurants
The fish may be cheap, but in actual quality terms, this is pound for pound as noble as turbot.|restaurants
Luscious, moist and pearlescent flakes of platinum|restaurants
Jeremy was very humble about it when he brought it over, citing the minimal intervention in his application of heat, but I’m sure he knows he smashed this one out of the park|restaurants
Perfect fish cookery, a joy to see London chefs respecting British catch with care and skill like this|restaurants
This is what it’s all about|restaurants
Crazy delicious!|restaurants
Tekkers and then some, this is pretty much perfect chicken|restaurants
Brined, taken to precisely the right temperature, the flesh is loose and yet remains incredibly juicy.|restaurants
Also an interesting cut, length wise like a steak|restaurants
I’m trying to work out of it’s a really big old bird, or if it’s two breasts stitched together, if the latter the effect is seamless|restaurants
I wish I could make chicken this good, never gonna happen|restaurants
So impressive and utterly delicious.|restaurants

Northumberland lobster, tail grilled and served with lettuce and field peas grown in Georgia|restaurants
With a salad of claw on steamed turnip cake (their version of moin-moin).|restaurants
This tail rubbed in suya butter was grilled to a perfect mi-cuit|restaurants
A healthy animal, perfect size looks about 800g, sweet with satisfying natural bite in its texture.|restaurants
This light stew of field peas cooked in bacon are textured more like beans to me, it has a comfort factor similar to say feijoada, and the heartiness being a contrast to the purity of the shellfish, and the sweetness of the lettuce|restaurants
The dish is assembled well, nothing in excess, everything purposeful and in balance.|restaurants
The steamed veg cake simultaneously reminded me of Chinese turnip cake (Lo pak go) and a mini crumpet, topped with claws|restaurants
Nips and lobster really do go well together, and yes I know you’re thinking about that one with the transparent slices and thick honey sauce, well this one is better than that one|restaurants
Bonus side dish, pop it in after you finish the tail.|restaurants
Bjorn Frantzén was in London for one night only, pitching up at Bibendum’s on a tuesday night in May to do a collaboration with our Claude Bosi|Bibendum
I was rather excited about it, a dinner with two two leading lights in gastronomy at the peak of their powers, in the same very kitchen cooking the meal was something to experience.|restaurants
However, the menu itself did cost half a kidney, at £280pp, plus service and drinks, we ended up paying about £414pp for this meal (we drank a bottle of 2009 Aligote from Leroy).|restaurants
I have been very curious about Bjorn’s cuisine for a while now – all the photos of his dishes look top notch, grandiose French-Kaiseiki cuisine with peak condition produce from the ice cold waters around Scandinavia|restaurants
 Bjorn had brought the entire Stockholm team over, and they had split the kitchen and the pass into two halves|restaurants
Franco was on side with Claude on their side of the pass, and Marcus Jenmark headed the other side.|restaurants
As for the dinner – absolutely brilliant|restaurants
Even with a sneak preview of his dishes, you can really see why this guy is Sweden’s first three star chef|restaurants
Very curious about getting to Stockholm after this showing.|restaurants
that is if I can get a table at Restaurant Frantzen.|Restaurant Frantzen
my recent meals at Bibendum, and really think he is ready for the 3 stars in the UK red guide|Bibendum

Chawanmushi with broth made from 100 day aged pork, pork rinds and caviar from a new supplier to the restaurant, a French oscietra.|restaurants
Enveloped in incredibly deep umami, with clear hints of dry age funk in its cheese-like finish|restaurants
The broth was not unlike a ramen tonkotsu, albeit one that is a clarified and ultracharged consommé.|restaurants
I included a video of Bjorn presenting this dish above, a version of it has remained on his menu since he started with Daniel in 2008|restaurants
On paper it’s three humble ingredients, the onion being the starting point for almost everything, but the way he’s decided to cook the ingredients, bring them together, and his choice of textural contrasts resulted in a riveting experience of seemingly unending layer upon layer of interchanging savouriness, acidity, sweetness, salty, luxurious creaminess, incredibly all with the flavours of the primary products.|restaurants
The deep, sweet onions, the off kilter liquorice and the crunch of the roasted nuts|restaurants
At its core, this dish is comfort food, it’s a bowl of onions and nuts, but a spoonful of this ..🤯|restaurants
The flavour extractions are mind boggling.|restaurants
I can see why he’s kept this on ever since his debut|restaurants
It was the best dish of the meal, an impressive demonstration of the team’s 🌟🌟🌟 caliber|restaurants
If the guys can do this in someone else’s kitchen (albeit a very, very good one), it’s exciting to think of what they are pushing out in Stockholm.|restaurants
Meanwhile, the wine pairing – a curious rainwater medium dry Madeira – was in perfect unison with the dish, and an inspired choice|restaurants
A fairly fresh and pure style, with a touch of oxidative nuttiness to match the roasted nuts in the dish|restaurants
The rainwater refers to way it is made, barrels left uncorked, allowing rainwater to seep and lighten the wine|restaurants
Top drop by Carl Frosterud.|restaurants
Not to be outdone, Claude and Franco sprung their latest nosotto (i.e|restaurants
no-rice risotto) development|restaurants
I remember having the sweetcorn version last fall, but this one is a totally killer dish.|restaurants
Potatoes finely diced, and carefully cooked to an al dente texture, it mimicked a risotto, in an emulsified sauce fully imbued with buttery goodness, and the satisfying depth of the cheese|restaurants
I love potatoes, in all the various prep, including as raw noodles, and this was something new that I could add to my taste memories|restaurants
It really was superiorly comforting, the ultimate comfort food feels, leave me in a room with a spoon and couple of bowls of this, I would happily polish it all off and ask for more|restaurants
To cut the richness, there is a dose of acidity, which I assume is from the mead gel, and a little freshness from citrus zest|restaurants
Topped with the best cut of chicken, two nuggets from it’s back|restaurants
To make something so special from humble ingredients|restaurants
Stunning dish!|restaurants
I really like where Claude’s cuisine is at right now, it’s happy medium between classic and modern|restaurants
If he gets the promotion, it would be the right decision by the Bib.|restaurants

Roasted Norwegian king crab, XO sauce, finger lime, yuzukosho beurre Blanc, chrysanthemum, London pine shoots, sea buckthorn and wild trout roe.|restaurants
Chilli crab so to speak, with three star execution|restaurants
There’s a light persistent spice, tempered by acidity, the firm trout roe and the sheer natural sweetness of the king crab|restaurants
Like the rest of Frantzén’s dishes, this is finely crafted with wide gamut flavours, remarkably amplified by how harmonious they are weaved together.|restaurants
I knew we were in store for something a little exciting with Claude on the meat course|restaurants
I’ve seen Passard’s duck and coffee sauce, as well as Phil Howard’s beef ribs and espresso, never ate either, but there is no question that coffee has its place in savoury dishes.|restaurants
No doubt Hibiscus fans will school me on the versions you’ve had at Maddox street|Maddox
For me, it’s the first time seeing an entire fillet of beef steaming itself inside a dough sealed Dutch oven and under a mound of coffee beans like this .|restaurants
First of all, the cuisson is perfect|restaurants
The perfect temperature, moist, glaze-like, a rosy pink|restaurants
The texture was loose, very tender and juicy|restaurants
In terms of flavour, the coffee imparted a light acidity, and who knew that coffee harmonised so well with beef|restaurants
Fillet being rather neutral in flavour was absolutely the right cut to infuse with flavour.|restaurants
With a swipe of the pickled walnuts, the flavour reminded me of beef and tomatoes, and this contrast was delicious|restaurants
If I am to be honest, personally, the coffee sauce seemed excessive, as a light jus with some more freshness would have sufficed for me, though it didn’t detract from the brilliance of the protein itself|restaurants
It was seriously a pristinely cooked tenderloin|restaurants
Beef so often is a boring choice for a taster menu, but not this one|restaurants
A bold dish!|restaurants
…..yes I too was apprehensive seeing the vegetable in a pudding, but to my surprise, this was delicious! The coconut and white chocolate are the dominating flavours, the savoury elements there to create contrast with the sweet, and the overall profile then morphs into something redolent of kaya|restaurants
With the texture of rolled coconut flesh, this experience reminded me of the varied flavours of “Tong Sui” 糖水, which depending on who makes it would feature a myriad of ingredients you wouldn’t think should be in pudding|restaurants
If you know Hibiscus, then you know Claude has never been afraid to push the boundaries|Hibiscus
In this case, a genius move that paid off tremendously|restaurants
I loved it|restaurants
Superb finish to a memorable collaboration|restaurants
If you see this on the menu, take the plunge.|restaurants
Your meal looks superb , some of the dishes are stunning (King Crab)|restaurants
Bloody expensive though Kang and I`m wondering if I counted out “Eighty two” ( yes, 82 ) x £10 notes into your hand you would turn the clock back and grab the cash….That`s an awful lot of money for a meal|restaurants
 Bahhhh , maybe I`m just a miserable old man 😉|restaurants
hah, yes it was very expensive, I wish it wasn’t but at the same time, but these two guys are veterans at the very top of their profession|restaurants
Quality costs money, otherwise nobody would take up a career doing this stuff|restaurants
I’d like to be rewarded if I was good at my job|restaurants
Also I went with 3 mates, so technically it’s 41 x £10 – cost of meal for myself|restaurants
Still, it is cheaper than travelling to Stockholm, as well as having a meal at Bosi and Frantzen separately.|Bosi,Frantzen
It’s been over a year since Wagyu Mafia crew were in London to ‘perform’ (in their vernacular) a one-off event (titled Grilleasy) for the OAD awards ceremony for the|Wagyu Mafi
It was a fantastic evening with this crew’s first (of many, I hope) London event, in which they pulled together an exciting showcase of wagyu through a myriad of cuts, culminating with 80 day aged sirloin simply grilled in a josper, and of course their famous Kobe fillet cutlet sandwich|restaurants
The meal also featured all other cuts including round, ribeye cap, tail, shank, chuck, ribeye, sirloin, fillet and its prized fat (in an old fashioned no less)|restaurants
Hamada san’s Ozaki (as in Mr Ozaki’s beef to be exact|Ozaki

Pictures and descriptions from a revisit to Ben Marks’ ever improving Perilla|Perilla
This time, I asked Ben if he would  make his Blackbird dish which he entered for GBM 2019, to which he kindly obliged|restaurants
I’ve been thoroughly impressed by the young Chef’s progression ever since he started up a few years ago in Stoke Newington|restaurants
Perilla has flourished into an exciting restaurant to dine at, whilst still remaining amazingly affordable, and I have no doubt we will see more accolades go to Ben’s name as he and his business partner Matt Emmerson continue to solidify their reputation in British gastronomy.|Perilla

A whole roasted quail boned out, stuffed with cooked pearl barley, shallots, hen of the woods, late season winter black truffle, lardo|restaurants
It sits in a deep sauce made from mushrooms, truffle and squid ink for extra black|restaurants
Finally it is finished with blackened mushroom powdered and a plum compote.|restaurants
A masterpiece of a dish|restaurants
It is visually striking, instantly iconic in its minimalist plating|restaurants
As it is fully boned-out, it cuts easily with a dinner knife, and the earthy aroma release is superb|restaurants
The craft involved is spot on|restaurants
There is a huge dose of umami and the comfort factor is high|restaurants
Inside the cavity, there is a layer of shaved truffle, then lardon melting into the pearl barley, all warm inside and soaking up all of the juices, analogous to say rice with Hainanese chicken (so to speak) – it gives familiar and immeasurable satisfaction.|restaurants
Along with the sweet and juicy quail, the earth of the truffle and mushrooms, the lardons, the deep sauce and finally the acidity from the jam to contrast and balance|restaurants
All the elements harmonise incredibly, and the eating experience is nothing short of exhilarating.|restaurants
I’ve been surprised many times @perilladining , Ben is a non-stop idea factory (Eton mess tart 🤯), and this number he crafted for the GBM music theme is a blinder|restaurants
This should have gone all the way! A special dish, I love it.|restaurants
Yet another top notch pudding, to add to Ben’s long list of hits going back to day one! Its silky smooth and extremely sinful.|restaurants

You might be familiar with Steve’s previous restaurants, Drake’s and on the Pond before that, though I’ve been to neither|Drake’s, the Pond
His new digs in Dorking is however an absolute wonder|restaurants
This is his kitchen, robed in natural sun light and encased in glass.|restaurants
Richard Giles is Steve’s Head Chef, and the pair are regularly seen cooking rather comfortably in their kitchen (as is also seen above)|Steve’s
The rest of the restaurant has this cottage feel to it, with low hanging wooden beams, the ambiance here reminds me very much of the charm that The Fat Duck’s dining room possesses.|restaurants
The talent pool appears to be spreading outside of London, where I speculate that rents and rates aren’t as relentless, and Chefs have a little more breathing space to develop their cuisine without constantly having to chase the bottom line month to month.|restaurants
I particularly like the fact that these guys try to source as much as they can locally|restaurants
They serve Dorking ale and source their duck from Etherly Farm, a stones throw from the restaurant and is of stellar quality.|restaurants
beans and other fancier ones like the Blue Mountain, and offers them as drip/filter|restaurants
Well worth going for that to finish.|restaurants
I’ve been three times and I adore the restaurant|restaurants
The team work as a cohesive unit like clockwork to make the show more than worth the price of entry|restaurants
Steve and team continue to cook with supreme confidence in delivering elegant and harmonious dishes, meanwhile Miguel and FOH work hard to make sure people feel right at home|restaurants
As we are at the transition from Spring to Summer, I definitely recommend a trip to Dorking on a sunny Saturday morning – it would be nourishment for the soul.|restaurants
There are ALCs and Taster menus here, starting from £45 for lunch and his ‘Discovery’ taster menu tops out at £95 for 9 courses.|restaurants
Pictures and descriptions below, from three lunch visits for their lunch ALC menu, all as table of two|restaurants
Average bill per meal was around £70pp including half bottles of wine and coffee.|restaurants
Oils of the sea meeting oils of the land, flavours abound, tied together with charcoal and brightened up with controlled use of acidity|END
Banging dish.|restaurants
Roast breast with tamarind, slow braised leg with ras el hanout, a little duck sausage, with saffron carrot purée and romanesco broccoli|restaurants
Beautifully roasted bird accompanied by plenty of umami.|restaurants
I really liked this one, an understated, intelligent study of flavours that go together hand in hand|restaurants
The endive I’m told has been firstly cooked in some local Dorking ale, and presumably charred to finished|restaurants
Ive always found that browned endive’s flavour is very close to that of truffle, and it really went a long way to pump up the -let’s say- more humble tuber of the season, together serving as the earthy backbone of the dish|restaurants
The rest of the dish provides the salt, and those plums brought the fireworks in the acidity department|restaurants
Sophiscated stuff for sure.|restaurants
On cuisson, this was as perfect a Pollack as I’ve ever seen and tasted|restaurants
Glimmering nacre, and beautiful translucent flakes all over|restaurants
I love the disc of smoked marrow, it adds meatiness to compliment the fish’s clean flavour|restaurants
This being the prime example of the exemplary work which Steve and team are doing here|restaurants
A true spectacle.|restaurants
Of course, this is only possible with immaculate day boat catch from the South West|restaurants
A fish with flakes that are as firm as the noblest in the sea, and when it is cooked as well as this, I can hardly tell the difference between it and say, turbot|restaurants
It remains an underpriced gem, which is a good thing for us all I suppose.|restaurants
Hibiscus poached pear, goats yoghurt, cardamom, crystallised ‘tablets’ of Poire Williams with liquid centre, shortbread crumble and incredibly snappy and shiny tuiles of thinly sliced pear|restaurants
deceptively simple, but it’s so well made and balanced that the entire thing simply floats on the palate.|restaurants
The parfait is made with walnut, praline and celeriac, giving the cold parfait earthy depth and body, akin to say sweet potato or yam puddings|restaurants
Blackberry added a burst of jamminess, and all of it rounded off with the Bramley apple and sorrel sorbet|restaurants
Very slick work, clean but also satisfying.|restaurants
Like my first visit, puddings were a highlight, and going by photos on IG, it certainly looks a very capable pastry chef runs the section here.|restaurants
Having followed the rise of Restaurant Florilege with great interest for the last few years, I’m glad to have finally made it not just to honten, but also to the crew’s sister restaurant located in Daan, Taipei.|restaurants
I’m certain you’ve already come across Hiroyasu Kawate, his gastronomic stock has been on the rise year on year, with his recent elevation to two star status as he continues to cook his heart out in leafy Aoyama, Tokyo|restaurants
He is a practitioner of classic cuisine but like many things in the land of the Rising Sun, the soul of this restaurant is very much Japanese, with his craft directed at expressing the very best of the many jewels of Japanese terroir, rather than to simply import fish from Brittany.|restaurants
Kawate san has had his entire career immersed in French cuisine, starting out under a Chef named Masahiko Ohara, who plies his trade in Roppongi|restaurants
After that, he went onto Le Bourguignon also in the vicinity, and then jetting off to stint at Le Jardin des Sens in Montpellier|restaurants
After returning to Japan, he went to work for Shuzo Kishida of the hallowed Quintessence before finally opening Florilege in 2009|restaurants
Kawate had moved his restaurant in 2015 (the former space now occupied by the brilliant|restaurants
, also helmed by Quintessence alumnus) to the currently roomier and expansive open kitchen counter table dining room|restaurants
Entering his 10th year as chef patron, he also welcomes a fresh michelin star win for his second act in Taipei called Logy.|restaurants
The notion of the crew opening in Taipei, to work with the excellent but underrated Taiwanese terroir, was music to my ears|restaurants
Given that I was in both countries for this trip, i grabbed the chance to experience both restaurants back to back|restaurants
Kawate san has entrusted logy’s slick open counter kitchen – mirroring Florilege’s own – to Ryogo Tahara, his former sous for the last 3 years, naming it to signify the blending of Asian culture, grounded in Taiwanese soil|restaurants
You can read up their|restaurants
on how they finally decided to call it that, though most conveniently, logy phonetically is similar to roji; Japanese for alley way, which is where you will find the restaurant in Da’an district|restaurants
Like Florilege, Tahara san’s cuisine is modern and unique, yet it is realised mostly through classic technique and showcases his ongoing study of the riches of Taiwanese produce.|restaurants
Both restaurants only do taster menus, logy’s is carte blanche (for 3750NT / £95pp), Florilege’s menu give vague descriptions of the courses|restaurants
Each menu is about the same length, 6-7 savouries and 3 puddings|restaurants
Florilege has an additional shorter lunch menu, 6 courses for 7500yen /£55, though we opted for the long one (15000yen / £110)|restaurants
It is worth mentioning that Florilege has an excellent option for a soft pairing flight|restaurants
I chose it, and its variety of tea, sparkling juices and fruit/veg extractions all carefully made by the barman to compliment each dish is superb.|restaurants
Both chefs spend the majority of service on the stoves, especially with the meat courses, all slowly grilled and then finished on the pan prior to plating up|restaurants
The skill is evident, all delivered on hot plates -as it should be for work this fine- with both chefs pursuing their own unique creations, molded around the seasons|restaurants
In both cases I was very impressed with how both Kawate and Tahara had each masterfully weaved together a coherent retelling of the terroir they were working with|restaurants
It was clear that their kitchens are fertile ground for the mentoring of fine craftsmen, and perhaps potential star chefs of the future|restaurants
Florilege was definitely the more established act of the pair, their two star rating more than justified in terms of the kitchen’s technical prowess.|restaurants
Although totally different, Florilege does feel like a Tokyo parallel of my own beloved Ledbury here in London, somewhat kindred spirits in the way they view gastronomy|restaurants
Both men are classically trained but shun French products, instead eagerly direct their attention to the locality around them, concerned about food waste (Brett makes compost from his kitchen waste, which punters can take home, which I have on a few occasions for our garden) and both are especially gifted in identifying value in otherwise unloved ingredients or cuts by transforming them into something unexpectedly special.|restaurants
In Brett’s case, he makes ethereal carpaccio slices by clay cooking irregularly oversized beetroots that are usually binned by farmers|restaurants
Meanwhile Kawate san makes a luscious cold shabu-shabu from the loin of cows which have given birth to calves – meat that would never grace the menu of fine Japanese steak houses which -amongst other things- demand virgin cows|restaurants
There is a lot to admire when a chef is able to raise noble produce to new heights of course, but it takes true genius to make something out of nothing.|restaurants
Finally some words on the younger restaurant, logy and it certainly intrigues me because Tahara san is only at the outset of his Taiwanese odyssey|restaurants
As I mentioned earlier, Taiwan is bursting at the seams with quality produce that is only beginning to get the global coverage it deserves|restaurants
There is much untapped potential yet as I am sure Tahara san will continue to develop as he discovers and codifies more creations using Taiwanese produce|restaurants
The man is young and enthusiastic and I have no doubt we will hear more of logy’s rising star in the years to come.|restaurants
Though unannounced, this appears to be reconstituted to look like you’re pulling baked sweet potato from a pile of burning ash|restaurants
I’m pretty sure they’ve pureed it through a tamis, then and encased in fried crispy shell|restaurants
An aromatic amuse to kick things off.|restaurants
This was the first entree of the taster menu, and a fantastic start|restaurants
Full of flavour and texture, composed entirely of squid, tentacle to fin eating.|restaurants
With a creamy shiitake broth, nagano cheese, a chawanmushi and summer truffles, aka cheap truffles which do very little to nothing|restaurants
With all the colours of Spring, this spectre of winter brown felt a little out of place if I am honest|restaurants
It was nice, but no more.|restaurants
Kawate san’s drive toward reducing food waste, with a message highlighting the 17,000,000 kgs of food that Japan bins annually.|restaurants
Beef is the chosen vessel, ‘delivered’ cows from Miyazaki, perhaps never meant for the fine Niku houses whose USP are champion high BMS beef from strictly virgin cows|restaurants
For our sitting, the cow was 11 years old at slaughter, its loin cut about half an inch thick, lightly cured by air drying, then left to marinade in beef stock in the fridge, which also features in the richly flavoured cold consommé in the eventual dish|restaurants
It sits on potato puree pushed through an iSi whipper, and finished with herb oil at the table|restaurants
The dish is finely made, with classic, well balanced beef and mash flavours|restaurants
It has the sensation of cold shabu-shabu, the cure redolent of Spanish cecina, the moisture draw limited, reducing the beef to an attractive, slightly bouncy chew, and a subtle beefiness that persists|restaurants
The overall palate is satisfying savouriness|restaurants
Objective achieved: Things we throw away can be every bit two star delicious.|restaurants
Back to the topic of food waste, it is intriguing to think about how it differs one country to another|restaurants
While in Japan, people pay top yen for the aforementioned beef from virgin wagyu; throughout Europe, it is older cows (incl ex-dairy) which are sought after for both flavour (high b-carotene fat and tremendous marbling) and texture.|restaurants
Meanwhile in the UK, we have Rose veal that is both ethical and delicious|restaurants
Bull calves, i.e., half the births are literal by-products of milk production|restaurants
They live for at least a year on grass, before slaughtering for beef – as opposed to simply shooting them at birth.|restaurants
Outside of beef, there’s perception of what is deemed prime cut|restaurants
Where one cuisine might prize say fish heads (cheek, throat, eye, collar) and poultry thighs, others don’t think twice about chucking in stock|restaurants
Ultimately the best chefs r resourceful, and tend to respect whole animals, the gift of terroir, which I suppose is the spirit of gastronomy.|restaurants
Although presented as sweet, the fish was predominantly bitter, to match with the bitterness of the mountain veg|restaurants
The fermented sauce was much like an XO|restaurants
Sambal fish so to speak|restaurants
The fish presentation was great; grilled on skewers, though for me, i felt it was the weakest dish of the meal.|restaurants
The dish being sheets of bamboo shoot layered in between delicate scallop mousse (potato as binder?), resembling a reverse millefeuille, soft on the outside|restaurants
It is cooked entirely in steam then given a hit of dry heat for a little colour on the exterior just prior to plating|restaurants
It eats incredible well, contrast of textures and flavours – earth and sea|restaurants
Pure tekkers!|restaurants
Hamaguri clam also features in this dish, with half a clam, and then as a sauce|restaurants
Its essential juices emulsified with some butter give the dish a rich saline backbone|restaurants
Finally, the tea powder imparts bursts of umami complexity (not unlike seaweed), taking the dish as a whole to a state of peak deliciousness.|restaurants
, and harmonising with the food to great effect|restaurants
Here, Ohba san has made a mocktail from amazake (non-alcoholic sake lees), kinome, sancho and topped with meringue|restaurants
Delicious drink in its own right.|restaurants
This is very fine work|restaurants
Exciting, natural flavours, seasonal, terroir driven, plenty of craft and perhaps best of all, a dish that is simple in appearance, but tastes anything but|restaurants
For me this dish reaches a little beyond its two star rating.|restaurants
Wonderfully grilled, with the subtle flavour of charcoal, and very little to no salt on the fish, highlighting it’s natural sweetness|restaurants
I included a video (|restaurants
Simply titled “To share”, for this sitting, an entire rack of pork cooked whole and on the bone, presented to punters, and then back to the kitchen|restaurants
@hiroyasu_kawate is seen taking the meat off the bone to finish it on the pan, prior to plating|restaurants
Served simply with rice that’s been brushed with sauce, then precisely caramelised and crisped up only on one side (doubling as crackling), with the other side remaining as perfectly cooked rice, just a touch al dente.|restaurants
The 2019 prices have risen nearly across the board, though quality remains ever so high here at L’Arpege|restaurants
Spontaneity and creativity reign supreme, Passard and his kitchen still immensely spirited in their practice of gastronomy at the highest levels, they continue to introduce new dishes to their menu, not bad for a restaurant now in its 33rd year|restaurants
As usual, Tony Beldroega was in charge of the affairs today, with the Chef himself making an appearance mid-way through lunch to greet punters|restaurants
I had wanted to try Alain’s latest Frankenstein creation, the Chimera, pigeon stiched together with a rack of lamb, but alas it wasn’t on the menu on this visit.|restaurants
For this meal, I decided to try the Gardener’s lunch again, now 175€ ,  supplemented with a half portion of the lobster/vin jaune (now 210€ for the whole, 105€ for the half) and also asked kindly if I could try their vegetable tatin as well as their strawberries, now in its prime.|restaurants
As you might be familiar, the lunch menu is essentially themed around whatever vegetables they have in abundance from Alain’s two gardens|restaurants
They tend to repeat themselves over the course of the longish meal|restaurants
In the case of this meal, yellow round courgettes and white asparagus appeared to be at peak|restaurants
If you arrive at the restaurant around 11ish, you’ll see the little white van delivering their daily haul of greens.|restaurants
I feel that April/May is the best time to visit L’Arpege, especially if you are interested in vegetables|restaurants
All the colours are in full bloom, lobster and turbot are near their peaks, peas are sweet and strawberries are ripe and ready|restaurants
Cigalines instead of mara de bois or gariguttes this year.|restaurants
L’Arpege is a restaurant that continues to enthrall me, the cuisine is very much based on improvisation and it is very rustic and homely in many ways, the antithesis of rehearsed, static crafted tasting menus|restaurants
The food here is fine in its eating, while the dishes are beautiful to look at, the kitchen spends the majority cooking rather than plating little things perfectly|restaurants
Some people do not like it for this very reason, but I love L’Arpege because at the heart of it all, the restaurant is about pure cooking, slow grilled proteins cooked grand and whole, and daring la minute preparations for everything else|restaurants
It might seem counter intuitive to say this, but in today’s world of foraged, water bath modernism, L’Arpege is in the minority when it comes to actually delivering hot food on piping hot plates|restaurants
A pre-requisite as it always should be for any fine food that is cooked with love and respect!|restaurants
When you visit, it really is worth spending some time to study all their menus deeply, and then to make sure you speak up and ask for anything you want to try|restaurants
They can mix and match anything on their menus, and also stuff that’s not on their menus|restaurants
I cannot stress this enough, if you simply leave it up to them, chances are you will almost definitely be disappointed and wonder what the fuss is all about|restaurants
These guys love a challenge believe me, the more bespoke your menu is, the better the meal becomes|restaurants
It’s going to  cost an arm and leg regardless of what you do, so if you’ve made up your mind to go here, then do like Magnus Nilsson when he left L’Astrance and do it in style.|restaurants
I drank a most interesting wine, 2017 Les Vignes de Paradis Terroir du Léman Un Matin Face au Lac, which is made from 100% Chasselas, a grape that I don’t believe I’ve ever come across|restaurants
I wrote down chalky mango and peach on the nose, more of that on the palate, with oiliness to it|restaurants
Superb wine.|restaurants
Today with a consomme of asparagus, mint and thyme|restaurants
One of Alain’s classics, and one of my all time favourites from his oeuvre of vegetable cooking.|restaurants
All raw, beautifully composed, delicate and glassy textures|restaurants
It is very lightly seasoned, it doesn’t even have much in way of oil, a very sensitive and pure dish showcasing the natural flavour in which the Grand Cru vegetables from Alain’s gardens possess|restaurants
This is what I love about L’Arpege.|restaurants
I greatly enjoyed this meaty pate, loosely packed with the savouriness of duck fat and perfectly seasoned|restaurants
The peas were absolutely top notch, popping with brilliant sweetness|restaurants
I could eat a bowl of them! Printemps in overdrive.|restaurants
11|restaurants
Yellow round courgette with its flower stuffed with vegetables|restaurants
With a dollop of parsley puree and an emulsion of cauliflower and verbena|restaurants
Passard’s grand cru vegetables from his gardens meeting his kitchen’s three starred calibre craft|restaurants
This was incredible – roasted and fully imbued with smokey, charred flavours, the courgette itself of prime quality|restaurants
Meanwhile the flower was stuffed with a medley of superior savouriness, cooked down vegetables, onions, garlic, other things which my limited palate could hardly identify|restaurants
The sauce had deep flavour itself, backed up by luxurious and low density frothed creaminess and acidity, acting as a counterpoint to the roasted courgette.|restaurants
The layering of flavours fan out to cover all four tastes simultaneously leading to a wide gamut umami that had me scratching my head as to how they manage so much flavour extraction from purely just vegetables|restaurants
Genius dish, with its composition guided by the saturation of nature’s primary colours|restaurants
Exactly the sort of dish that only L’Arpege is capable of producing.|restaurants
I don’t have much love for this dish, as in the past I find the sweet and sour honey sauce both overly sweet and too acidic at the very same time|restaurants
On this occasion however, the sauce is reigned in, the sweet and acid gentle as opposed to a punch in the face|restaurants
Now I could taste the dance of sweetness between the ocean of the lobster and the earth of the translucent globe turnip slices|restaurants
The lobster this time round was cooked a pointe – just a touch mi-cuit|restaurants
This is a lovely dish when they get it right for sure.|restaurants
Decidedly simple, homely in appearance, adorned with chive flowers, though as we are at L’Arpege, the craft involved is a world class marvel|restaurants
It came piping hot, and no doubt cooked la minute as the pastry was still warm on arrival.|restaurants
As you must already be aware from the in-trend BBQ hispis that grace many restaurants today, this caramalised cabbage too transformed its raw, crunchy sweetness into something significantly more complex – meaty, smoky, fully softened yet remaining juicy at the very same time, suped up savouriness.|restaurants
The smoked eel puree was very concentrated, a swipe of it on the cabbage, buttered and well seasoned, and the flavours begin to harmonise – then the a-ha moment arrives – to the point when it feels like things are about to explode on the palate|restaurants
An inspired pairing, so simple, so perfectly seasoned and so utterly delicious.|restaurants
Of course the secret here is their supremely fine puff pastry, so delicate in its flakiness, that it gifts the tatin a soft and smooth texture, collapsing like a hot knife through butter with the gentlest push|restaurants
An embodiment of the genius comfort food and the exquisite craft of L’Arpege.|restaurants
Today with Spring cabbage, new potato and yellow round courgette|restaurants
Quartered lengthwise, each “aiguillette” position plated facing opposite directions with tail, tomalley and claw on the plate|restaurants
This dish is always served on a heavy plate that is piping hot, including the sauce taken to the highest temperature, frothed up to a lightened texture.|restaurants
It remains for me, the greatest preparation of Lobster I’ve ever tasted|restaurants
The vin jaune sauce, like all sauces at L’Arpège, is simply the finest|restaurants
The gastrique is perfect, the salt and acidity, the oxidative nuttiness of the wine, all these elements pulling and pushing to create harmony and tension with the lobster flesh and tomalley|restaurants
Put simply, I have not tasted a better sauce than this|restaurants
Today Tony has blended in some coral, yielding a light orange pigment, and adding layer of ocean sweetness to the sauce.|restaurants
The Chausey island lobster – tied rostrum to tail to keep the tail straight during its boil– is usually timed to mi-cuit, however on this visit, the tail was quite firm (firmer than the lobster/turnip served a few courses earlier), and to my taste a touch over, by a minute perhaps|restaurants
This was a pretty big lobster, looks 1kg mark|restaurants
It’s massive claw and knuckle on the other hand came out just right|restaurants
Saying this, the bounce on the meat was a sign of a healthy crustacean and didn’t detract from the overall experience|restaurants
I feel very fortunate to have had this a few times, I am perpetually in awe of it|restaurants
A dish of timeless magnificence.|restaurants
A decadent sugar rush that is incredibly light at the same time – such fine pastry work|restaurants
It evoked childhood memories of cream and honey, sugary sweets and honeyed ice cream|restaurants
I loved it.|restaurants
For me, this remains the gold standard of puff pastry|restaurants
Incredible fine and delicate flakes|restaurants
The chocolate is very pure, you can taste the bitterness and it comes without too much sweetness|restaurants
Personally, I prefer the vanilla MF over this one, but the all-chocolate puff pastry is definitely something to admire|restaurants
Class.|restaurants
Gariguttes have become synonymous with the European Spring and typically shows up on the menus here, so with a different DNA, I thought to give this a go|restaurants
These aren’t as fragrant as the gariguettes, rather balanced in flavour but quite juicy|restaurants
I wouldn’t say they are better than Mare des Bois either.|restaurants
It is pretty much as it says on the tin – strawberries in a honey sweet sauce that is followed closely by a jolt of acidity, finally the oils coating the palate.|restaurants
Beautiful review and writing … I just found out earlier this year that the classic lobster dish at L’Arpege happened to be “seasonal”|restaurants
I thought blue lobster from ‘Brittany’ area is available all year long (e.g|restaurants
you always find a lobster dish at L’Ambroisie)|restaurants
They are technically not seasonal and are indeed avaiable all year round|restaurants
But Lobsters in the English Channel between Dorset and Brittany are at their best around the summer, starting from say June and run till August|restaurants
July is probably the most plentiful month, and prices are cheapest|restaurants
I did have the lobster vin jaune in November last year.|restaurants
This time out at Rue Varenne, it was a full-on ALC affair, in the deep Autumn of 2018, during which arguably the best White Truffle season in memory was in full swing|restaurants
The Celerisotto dish was probably my best memory of white truffles anywhere|restaurants
Claude Bosi does a ‘nosotto’ with various vegetables through the seasons that I surmise is inspired by his time in L’Arpege’s kitchens decades before he opened in Ludlow.|restaurants
A portrait of Passard’s mentor, the great Alain Senderens (RIP) and former occupant of the same premises before Passard bought it over and turned L’Archestrate into L’Arpege, temporarily hung in the wall space just outside the kitchen, usually reserved for Louise Passard, his grand mother.|restaurants
I am a huge fan of French salt meadow lamb and its British parallel the salt marsh lamb|restaurants
Passard with his Breton roots of course serves the pre-sale lamb from Mont St Michel|restaurants
It is truly a privilege to taste the meat in its peak (contrary to marketing of lamb in Spring without having grazed on grass in the winter), salt marsh lamb season actually starts after July and continues into February.|restaurants
As with all things L’Arpège, the simplicity is striking but no less complex as the dish is prepared with the old fashioned adage of luxury – moelleux, yielding textures and delicate flavours|restaurants
With no hard edges, all flavour and texture harmoniously blend to singularly create this sumptuous comfort effect with each spoonful.|restaurants
The celeriac cooked to a touch of bite, its natural sweetness tempered by the soft, mild and creamy emulsion|restaurants
The plate comes piping hot, with the shaved Bernard Antony Comte becoming a mixture of crumbly and soft edges just melting on to the sauce, all the while lending its saltiness to season the dish|restaurants
This subtle dish basically keeps itself in check to accentuate and harness the precious aromas of white truffle; subtle but persistent, and of course intoxicating|restaurants
Produce, technique and class – it’s one of those that produce the sort of magic headiness because of how balanced Passard’s cuisine is when it is expressing flavour in its purest form.|restaurants
It’s been an exciting season for the vaunted white truffle, now in its prime in both quality and abundance, and surely the best season in recent memory.|restaurants
4|restaurants
Breton turbot from the Gulf of Morbihan, parsley emulsion, carrot purée, cabbage, potatoes, bay leaf and matcha|restaurants
(87.50€)|restaurants
Le Geste for the noble fish is slowly grilled whole over low heat, which sounds simple, but is far from it|restaurants
And for me, it is where the romantic notion of Chef’s ‘feeling’ and timing comes into the picture|restaurants
The FOH presents the turbot to the table on a silver platter prior to carving|restaurants
Some gentle hands required to keep this in one piece during the cooking/flipping as is, especially a big boy this big, which must looks at least 6kg, eyeballing it.|restaurants
I was served a quarter cut from the tail end of the white-side, with inner fins intact|restaurants
While I prefer fillet top neck from the dark-side, the cuisson was naturally wonderful – juicy, flaky, a little sweet (since it’s the white-side) and gelatinous|restaurants
As you’ve likely experienced elsewhere (i.e|restaurants
Getaria) , the skin is chewy-crispy due to the slow grilling process, and itself adds flavour and dimension to the turbot.|restaurants
It is difficult to articulate just how good Passard’s vegetables really are, and at times they are the very reason why the dishes taste so special, which I’m sure can be attributed to the way he manages the terroir at his various farms|restaurants
Of course, Passard’s great gift in his composition of ingredients, guided by instinct in finessing the overall flavours so they knit together, but also ensuring that purity of natural flavour is always at the fore.|restaurants
Poached with a string tied head to tail (thus the straight tail when cut length wise), and expectedly to a perfect mi-cuit|restaurants
In true Passard flamboyance, the lobster cooked la minute is paraded whole (in an equally impressive large copper pan) at the table before disappearing back to the kitchen for final prep.|restaurants
The entire animal is presented on a piping hot plate, that is to say claw, tail and also tomalley, which I love|restaurants
As is the hallmark of Breton lobsters, the tail has bite and bounce in texture|restaurants
And finally, you discover the true brilliance with a sip of that superlative vin jaune sauce|restaurants
Its layers beautifully built up giving way to a kind of vitality as it hits the palate|restaurants
The sweet, the gastrique, the silky mouthfeel, ridiculous perfection, of which there is (almost) no equal.|restaurants
Perfect cuisson as expected at this level, edge to edge pink, likely from a long, slow roast, as is Passard’s rotisserie heritage|restaurants
The focus here is certainly on the produce, and at L’Arpège selection is almost always impeccable|restaurants
Now is a good time of the year for pré-salé lamb (including the Welsh equivalent), given their grazing patterns/slaughter age/hangtime.|restaurants
It’s so difficult get hold of these whole animals in London, So I certainly covet this experience whenever I get the chance|restaurants
For me the minerality of the oyster sauce is a logical pairing for the lamb in the natural flavour of the meat has definitely taken on its salt marsh grazing diet.|restaurants
As you know I love tonkatsu and this year chose to visit this relative newcomer to the Tonkatsu scene, which is slowly gaining exposure, perhaps notably on|restaurants
They open their doors at 11am, and we arrived at half past ten on a Friday, in which we were the first in the short queue that formed shortly thereafter|restaurants
There’s about 15 seats around the kitchen counter, and everybody got in when the doors opened.|restaurants
We ordered two lunch sets – the rosu/sirloin (190g 1500yen / £11) and choice hire/fillet katsu (140g 3500yen / £26), and a side order of fried pork neck|restaurants
The set comes with Hokkaido Yumepiraka rice (one free top up), cabbage, pickles and soup|restaurants
In addition to the typical katsu sauce, they also serve their pork with olive oil and sea salt – this being one of their USP.|restaurants
The other is that they buy their carcasses in whole and are then able to offer a sort of tonkatsu tasting menu comprised of various cuts|restaurants
This isn’t offer for lunch service, rather you need to (and can) book a seat between the hours of 3 and 5pm to have this taster menu, for 3500yen|restaurants
Something you should definitely consider if you are about, and don’t have early dinner plans as we did when we visited.|restaurants
The quality of pork itself is tremendous, from Miyagi prefecture, the pigs’ diet include an array of Chinese herbs, which (amazingly) results in inherently tender flesh, a notably sweet, mellow flavour and without apparent need for further brining or ageing.|restaurants
Fried hot (eyeballing panko colour, looks standard 160/170C) and fast say 5mins, rested 3-4 mins, and it is cooked perfectly to just a blush of pink|restaurants
Moist and juicy, yet the katsu is surprisingly light on the palate, and on the gut, you leave with a “clean” feeling rather than a queasiness.|restaurants
As I finished my meal, I saw that they did takeaway orders of katsu sandwich, and also asked for one as well – they go for about a tenner (1500yen).|restaurants
So glad to be back in Tokyo, I love katsu so much and I think this place is great, doing all the right things|restaurants
It doesn’t yet have the big queues which Narikura entertains, so it is worth your while if you love katsu as much as I do.|restaurants
This was delicious – strands of fat interspersed within the muscle, fried until all of the fatty meat is steaming itself until lusciously soft and simply melts away on the palate|restaurants
Fantastic with rice.|restaurants
III Forks in Chicago’s River North has earned a platinum reputation for being one of the best places in the city to find a good steak, and it’s on the way to earning an equally distinguished reputation for its vegetable offerings|restaurants
Off-the-cob cream corn highlights the Midwest’s premier crop, and you can also enjoy sautéed spinach (a classic side for steak) and seasonal vegetables, all harvested at the height of freshness to make your steak dinner even more special.|restaurants
Broccoli is the favorite vegetable of…some people|restaurants
At STK Chicago, broccoli is raised to unheard of heights of deliciousness with a bacon vinaigrette and a crumble of foie gras, special ingredients you’re not likely to find anywhere else, both complementing the lush green deliciousness of this in-season vegetable|restaurants
The Foraged Mushrooms are a special side, featuring fungi that require a lot of time and attention to find in the forest, and the perfect side dish to one of STK’s magnificent steaks.|restaurants
You know you’re in for some high-quality produce when the steakhouse menu has a special section devoted to veggies|restaurants
In addition to many salads, including the classic Caesar, there’s broccolini with garlic and oil, a classic accompaniment to red meat, Brussels sprouts with crispy pancetta, as well as a whole platter of vegetables, magnificent|restaurants
You might actually be tempted to forego the steak and enjoy just the vegetables (but that would be a mistake; you’ll want at least a filet to go with the veggies, or you’ll be hungry later).|restaurants
|restaurants
So many of the items served at Maple & Ash have had a brief appointment with the huge wood fires that cook and flavor just about everything served here, including steaks, of course, but also many thoughtful vegetable preparations|restaurants
The Wood-fired Maitake Mushrooms are the perfect accompaniment to the prime steaks; the smokiness in both harmonize with one another perfectly|restaurants
The sweet corn with garlic butter and basil is sourced from Klug Farms, a local producer recognized for outstanding quality, and the asparagus is something special with orange, almond and mint.|restaurants
At Prime & Provisions, there’s the prime steak…and then there’s the provisions, some of the most delicious produce you will find in any restaurant, including a steakhouse|restaurants
Look in the “gluten-free” menu to find some truly outstanding vegetable offerings, including Tuscan Kale and Romaine Caesar and also Pickled Purple Cauliflower with carrots and fennel|restaurants
Vegetables this good make every bite of USDA prime beef even more delicious.|restaurants
making life easier for us by serving food that is going to make all of us happy|restaurants
Add to that the bonus that we don’t have to cook, or clean up, and we’re all going to split the bill, so it’s actually a very economical way to enjoy each other’s company|restaurants
On Thanksgiving Day, from 2pm until 10pm, Artango Steakhouse will offer a three-course prix fixe menu for $55 per person ($20 for children aged 6-12).|restaurants
We have a dear old-friend, let’s call him Norbert, who has proclaimed many times that “Thanksgiving food is totally drab and boring.” He says he doesn’t like the bland turkey, the gloppy gravy, the sour cranberry sauce…and don’t even get him started on the candied yams with marshmallows on top.  Every year, he whines that nearly all the food at Thanksgiving is “under-seasoned to the point of invisibility.”|restaurants
Now, just to be clear, Norbert may be a snob but he’s not a sociopath; he likes being around people, and he likes chatting at a table of good food – he just doesn’t think there’s much good food to be had at a Thanksgiving table.|restaurants
Executive Chef Saul Roman’s menu is a nod to traditional Thanksgiving standards (like stuffed turkey breast) but it also features some nontraditional holiday options like ahi tuna ceviche, lobster bisque, grilled salmon and gelato.|restaurants
Spicing up the usual Thanksgiving entertainments (arguments about politics, about who was supposed to bring the creamed onions, etc.), there will be entertainment|restaurants
Live from Buenos Aires, the Guillermo Paolisso Trio will be playing a fusion of Latin jazz, Argentine folklore, Brazilian bossa nova and Argentine tango|restaurants
The music starts at 5pm, and even if you have Thanksgiving dinner at home, you might consider dropping by for some after-dinner entertainment.|restaurants
If you have a Norbert in your life, or just want to change it up a little for the holiday, consider Thanksgiving at Artango|restaurants
We’ve included the whole menu below, and if you want to learn more or make reservations, just visit|restaurants
Lindsey Marks – who performs burlesque as Lady Jack – is chatting in front of a large Alice in Wonderland painting in the downstairs dining room at|restaurants
, on W|restaurants
Randolph St.|restaurants
This new space, owned by Sophie Huterstein, who also owns L.A.’s The Wellesbourne, is next door to J.P|restaurants
Graziano, purveyor of exceptional Italian sandwiches since long before the Randolph Corridor became the most happening restaurant strip in Chicago.|restaurants
Marks is coordinating entertainment at The Darling, including burlesque acts, and as we chatted, the Alice in Wonderland painting scrolled up to reveal a singer doing his rendition of “My Funny Valentine.”|restaurants
A little bit of daring, and doing what isn’t expected, is a big part of what The Darling is all about|restaurants
Says Huterstein, “The Darling is an elegant hideaway that offers both an intimate dining and cocktail experience on one floor, and a decadent lounge-like social club on the next.”|restaurants
The ground Floor entryway is “hidden” behind a wall of flowers in what appears to be a flower shop|restaurants
 Currently, all the flowers are paper, but Huterstein says that they plan to sell real flowers from this “shop,” though it seems unlikely that they will be sold before the snow flies in Chicago.|restaurants
Chef James Martin, previously of A10, told us that what sets The Darling apart is “The balance of excellent service, food, cocktails and a wide range of entertainment|restaurants
People will see right away how beautifully different The Darling is from anything else in the city.”|restaurants
“We hope,” Huterstein adds, “that guests will get a kick out of the immersive/thematic details and moments of whimsy that serve to compliment delicious food, drink and genuine hospitality.”|restaurants
The first floor is all about the small plates|restaurants
The real standouts for us were the pork belly, a delicious combination of the belly, poached pear, pumpkin puree and crispy sage, as well as the shrimpiest shrimp toast we’ve had, big boys mounted on brioche smeared with garlic confit crema and dressed in saffron and cherry peppers.|restaurants
Upstairs on the second floor, there’s more performance space and bigger plates, like the Seafood Platter with house-smoked trout dip, crab cakes, and smoked mussels|restaurants
Huterstein seems especially excited about the Grilled European Sausages, currywurst and bratwurst, with German mustard, pretzels and gherkins.|restaurants
Some of the cocktails reflect the whimsical tone of The Darling|restaurants
The drink called The Darling Buds of May,” for instance, features egg foam on top of the drink imprinted with an alarmingly precise image of the flowers|restaurants
How did they get the lines on those flowers so sharp, the colors so clear? The answer is that they imprinted the images on an edible disk designed to dissolve into the cocktail|restaurants
Clever.|restaurants
Martin handles food on both floors, and in addition to Marks, entertainment will be managed by DJ/Dr|restaurants
Victor Nwankow|restaurants
When he isn’t working on his residency requirements at Stroger/Rush, Nwankow creates playlists for surgeons in the operating theater and guests at The Darling|restaurants
He also curates other DJs who will be invited in to entertain guests at this trippy, intriguing new place on Randolph.|restaurants
It doesn’t seem that Scotch whisky would be a great pairing with food: the spirit is big, sometimes smoky and seems like it could steamroll all but the most powerful flavors.|restaurants
But you might be surprised how well Scotch can pair with foods|restaurants
We were eager to try pairing Scotch whisky with Scottish-type food|restaurants
It doesn’t seem that Scotch whisky would be a great pairing with food: the spirit is big, sometimes smoky and seems like it could steamroll all but the most powerful flavors.|restaurants
Standing on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean outside the Ardbeg Distillery on the isle of Islay in Scotland, we were served glasses of the peaty whisky and locally harvested oysters, which we thought would surely be an imbalanced pairing|restaurants
But it wasn’t|restaurants
It was a beautiful pairing, proving the adage, “what grows together, goes together.” The whisky seasoned by the local salt spray matched the saltiness of the oyster pulled from local Islay waters, and the smokiness meshed with the oysters’ oceanic tang|restaurants
You like smoked oysters, right? Smoky whisky and oysters yield the same combination of flavors.|restaurants
is the gastropub on the west side of the old McCormick mansion, the urban palace built by the family of the Scots-Irish magnate Cyrus McCormick|restaurants
We tried the pairing of Kumamoto and Blue Point oysters with Oban 10 year old Scotch whisky, distilled oceanside in Scotland and evincing the brininess that works so well with oysters|restaurants
Oban lacks the peaty intensity of Ardbeg, enhancing the oyster flavor without peatiness|restaurants
With slight salinity seasoning both Oban whisky and the oyster, the flavor of the sea creature seemed to come through even more clearly|restaurants
Conclusion: both peaty and un-peated Scotch whisky pairs well with oysters.|restaurants
For a tartare made with salmon harvested in the Faroe Islands (about 200 miles north of Scotland), we switched to a 10-year-old Macallan|restaurants
A Speyside whisky distilled far away from the peat fields of Islay, Macallan has no notes of peat at all, which seemed like the right choice for a fish of this quality|restaurants
The light Dijon sauce and capers matched the relative lightness of the Scotch|restaurants
This was a superbly balanced pairing.|restaurants
Scallops also made a very good pairing with the Macallan, the light and sweet sherry notes of the whisky, aged in sherry barrels, was a very pleasant match for the light, sweet flavor of the scallops.|restaurants
Angus beef originated in Scotland, and for this heartier entrée, we chose the 10-year-old Ardbeg|restaurants
The peaty weight of this whisky matched the robust flavor of the Angus cap, and although the steak worked well with the beefy Scotch, the chimichurri sauce tasted just slightly off when washed down with whisky|restaurants
When we visit again, we’ll get the Angus beef cap with our Ardbeg but take a pass on this tangy green South American sauce, which we’ve had before and liked a lot, but which is not a friendly pairing with Scotch.|restaurants
For dessert, with a little Ardbeg still left in the glass, we ordered the sticky pudding, a U.K|restaurants
favorite: a spongy cake topped with toffee sauce and served with ice cream|restaurants
We greatly enjoyed the combination of smoky dram and sweet cake|restaurants
The sugariness of the pudding pleasingly played off the heaviness of the Scotch.|restaurants
Scotch with dinner is not for everyone|restaurants
If, however, you think you might like a wee drop with your meal, the whisky works much better than you might imagine|restaurants
Sometimes the whisky|restaurants
with what we were eating (as with the oysters at the beginning of the meal)|restaurants
Either way, it was an interesting experiment.|restaurants
One other advantage of having whisky with rich food is that the solvent qualities of the drink cleanse the palate and refresh the taste buds for the next bite|restaurants
You should try it, at least once, and a good place to do so is with a whisky or two and a few plates of Scottish-type food at SideDoor in River North.|restaurants
There was a time when dining out after hours meant your only choices were burgers, greasy slices of pizza or burritos as big as your head|restaurants

It was great to relive our younger years with Saved By The Max – Saved By The Bell Pop Up Shop Diner & Bar, the kitschy Bucktown/Wicker Park sensation that has since moved on to a permanent space in West Hollywood|restaurants
But now it’s time to grow up again—especially those of us who watched the show in its prime—as the owners have created the more sophisticated Dorian’s in its space|restaurants
To get to it, you must enter a record store selling the likes of Bessie Smith, David Bowie and Wes Montgomery on vinyl|restaurants
Dorian’s is an effortless experiment boasting a Michelin starred chef (Brian Fisher of Entente) and incredibly talented music director (Joe Bryl of Funky Buddha Lounge, Sonotheque and Maria’s Packaged Goods & Community Bar fame) kicking out rare groove, experiment jazz, Afrobeat and samba|restaurants
Most dishes from the Asian-focused menu are shareable, including mushroom wontons, chicken bao and the short rib banh mi|restaurants
The beverages are fun too, with large-format cocktails like the $70 Cookie Monster—which is served in a cookie jar-inspired container.|restaurants
You’ll also find a Michelin-starred chef overseeing the menu at this hip-hop inspired ramen joint boasting locations in Logan Square, Wicker Park and Wrigleyville|restaurants
Shin Thompson is behind the project and menu highlights range from the signature Furious ramen with chashu pork belly, spicy miso, white pepper chicken, “fury” sauce and a poached egg to Holy Cow ramen (chili-infused noodles, spicy beef bone soup, fresno chilies and ground beef and string bean stir fry)|restaurants
There are also cocktails on draft.|restaurants
The from-scratch, gastropub-style food from this Grand Rapids-based operation is meant to match the hundreds of craft beer selections|restaurants
Most items are also meant to share|restaurants
Pretzel Nuggz, for example, are flash-fried, salted and served with warm cheese sauce and spicy horsey mustard for dipping|restaurants
Meat Head pizza rolls are filled with pepperoni, cherry smoked bacon, chorizo and mozzarella|restaurants
And the signature Crack Fries—beer battered and sprinkled with HopCat’s signature cracked black pepper seasoning—may be topped with chili, poutine or sloppy Joseph mix.|restaurants
Since 1968, Kingston Mines has not only served as a Chicago blues institution, but as a worldwide phenomenon|restaurants
Musicians and tourists from all over visit this Lincoln Park music venue for entertainment 365 days a year|restaurants
The menu, served late night, offers soul food favorites, including barbecue ribs, fried chicken, red beans and rice, and jalapeno corn bread muffins|restaurants
While many of the dishes are fried, guests have the option of ordering a few such as catfish and shrimp in other styles|restaurants
They may order them grilled or blackened|restaurants
There’s a full bar menu.|restaurants
Updated Mexican fare is on offer at La Josie, a sleek West Loop lounge and eatery serving food late night|restaurants
It’s one of the area’s most popular places to frequent for larger groups because many dishes are share-able|restaurants
Guests should start off with one of the ceviches, which consist of camaron (tiger shrimp), huachinago (red snapper) and Mahi Mahi|restaurants
Tacos are the most popular item to order at La Josie|restaurants
Choose from al pastor (adobo pork), carnitas (baked pork shoulder), grilled Amish chicken or asada (grilled skirt steak)|restaurants
Other shareables include entrees like pollo rostizado of oven-roasted Amish chicken, black beans and Mexican rice or parrillada of grilled skirt steak, chicken breast, house-made chorizo, grilled veggies and rajas poblanos|restaurants
The beverage menu ranges from a mezcal Old Fashioned to craft beers on draft.|restaurants
is the latest Chicago establishment to jump aboard the pop-up restaurant/bar theme|restaurants
For them, it’s the infamous hangout of the “Beverly Hills, 90201” crew, who turned the cheery diner into an after-hours hot spot during a few seasons of the series|restaurants

Chef Mark Steuer—formerly of Carriage House, El Che Bar and Hot Chocolate—merges his heritage with his new restaurant in West Town|restaurants
He skillfully combines Southern accents with German classics on the menu at Funkenhausen|restaurants

It gets even better as the soundtrack consists of classic and contemporary funk during service.|restaurants
The Streeterville outpost marks the third in the Chicago area, plus there are others across the country|restaurants
In addition to its nautical theme, Hampton Social serves as a popular stop for after-work revelers|restaurants
Its cheery atmosphere makes it a popular destination for larger groups for after-work festivities as well as brunch|restaurants
Dishes that are shareable are most appealing, particularly brick-oven pizzas, jar of king crab, and “naked” shrimp consisting of pan-seared jumbo shrimp, coconut cream sauce, peanuts and peanut sauce.|restaurants
As I understand, up till now, Erchen has been the creative soul of the kitchen, but for Borough, she is sharing the role of developing the new menu with Anaïs van Manen, who works as a development chef for the Bao trio of owners.|restaurants
I tried three from the new line-up, my favourite ironically being the fried donut (reminiscent of fried mantou) with the lightly cooked, fleshy shrimp|restaurants
Of the pair of steamed buns, I enjoyed the one with fried cheese and tapioca pearls with curry and fermented chilli|restaurants
The fried cheese gooey, and the pearls go crispy like crispy rice – gorgeous|restaurants
Though, all three buns were greasy, all came with deep fried elements|restaurants
The steamed buns were a little dry during this visit, compared to other Baos, which I will chalk down as teething problems.|restaurants
I didn’t however fancy the cured pork jowl, like a “sweet” guanciale so to speak, served as carpaccio slices of cold fat swimming in chilli oil…not sure about it at all.|restaurants
I still find the size of buns too cute for the money, though it remains a good product, masterfully marketed (the new website is modern and gold standard stuff), slickly packaged, and rightly so are celebrated.|restaurants
Decor is nice, though does feel fake rustic, I personally like the original Soho design the most|restaurants
Wonder if lucky voice considers these guys real competition.|restaurants

for the last time in February this year|restaurants
It was one of my favourite new openings in London, as it stood apart from the mass market IG-friendly model, here was a Chef interested in developing a cuisine and identity that was uniquely his own|restaurants
It was Portuguese, but modern, textured and charged with acidity in the way say Taiwanese cuisine is (however unintentional) and reaching his end goals with classic technique, but slowed all the way down, long ageing his proteins, fermenting and also slow cooking his vegetables through application of very low heat sometimes over weeks|restaurants
You guys are well versed with Japan and France, but the flavours that excited Leo were altogether less common in London|restaurants
During this time, I witnessed some incredible new combinations and layering of flavours which I’d not seen anywhere else before|restaurants
Though there were a few things that pushed the boundaries even for me, on the whole however, it was an experience visiting Leo, as there was always something different on the table|restaurants
I thought then that perhaps it was only time required for London to catch up with Leo’s creativity, but alas Leo decided to call time on it|restaurants
Location and size didn’t help as foot fall was nearly non-existent, and that was the dagger that closed Londrino’s doors 18 months later.|restaurants
Though as one door closes, another one has opened, behind it is Alex Hunter, one half of the Bonnie Gull ownership|restaurants
Sited at Pavillion road in the fringes of Chlesea…|restaurants
a little like Chelsea’s version of Spa Terminus|restaurants
There’s a Natoora and Bread Ahead, a butcher that carries Galician Blondes and Iberico and there’s this fish bar that seemingly fits right in the crowd.|restaurants
The Sea, The Sea – so named after the Irish Murdoch book – for all the jazzed up interiors is actually a rather modest proposition – a fish shop by the day, and a (mostly raw) seafood bar by night.|restaurants
Leo’s role here is as Executive Chef for the food menu (which is to say he’s not here everyday), though expectedly he brings with him some of his ex-staff from Londrino|restaurants
The major difference between then and now is that he and his kitchen team are now handicapped in terms of kit, as compared to the spaceship laboratory kitchen that was Londrino|restaurants
But such is the irony of life, sometimes less is more|restaurants
With only a couple of portable hobs to steam shellfish and a few blowtorches to aburi and to quick smoke fillets, it has channeled Leo’s creativity in a focused manner, resulting in some smart, simple but no less creative dishes.|restaurants
, working within confines to liberate his cuisine, with seafood being close to his heart, due in no small part to his coastal upbringing, and then latterly during his time cooking in the Basque.|restaurants
It is a joy to see Leo C back in the game, he has such deep knowledge, with his creative streak, it will be exciting to follow his continually developing cuisine|restaurants
As mentioned, there are no stoves here, it is very much like Leo’s sushi ya, you’ll see him shucking oysters, dishing up his crudos, showcasing his tsukemono (all pickled in house) and opening up fillets of fish which he dry ages over salt right here in the shop.|restaurants
There is something special about this place|restaurants
Maybe it’s because of the kitchen limits, perhaps it is that Alex himself is also committed to the site|restaurants
Like a pet project, it has great energy, the simplicity of their food menu exactly the right counterpoint and confines for Leo to apply his intervention|restaurants
Most of all at the sharp end of the business, it fits right in the neighborhood|restaurants
If you love the odd seafood binge with your bubbly, you might like it here, and also be pleasantly surprised encountering the occasional flavour pairing revelation in Leo’s various cold preps.|restaurants
They’ve only just opened (in late April) and I’ve visited twice already|restaurants
The first in late May during lunch time, where they do a short snacks menu with oysters, sashimi and a select few dishes|restaurants
Dinner has the longer ALC menu with a bit more cooked food, and puddings.|restaurants
The second time was on the first monday of June , when Leo and Alex ran their very first masterclass – on native lobster|restaurants
Led by Leo, giving commentary as he killed, cooked and prepared the dishes live and on the spot for an small group of 8 (strangers)|restaurants
It was intimate, priced well (£120pp all in, including booze and service), respectful of the mighty native lobster, now in peak season, and it was banging|restaurants
The first of many I’m sure, well worth your time going to one.|restaurants
For this masterclass, Leo started things with his tsukemono and some Jersey rock oysters, with the house pickled beet vinaigrette and crushed hazlenuts.|restaurants
A lobster “sandwich” made from sushi rice that sat on a squid ink spring roll dough, with lemon and orange zest, apricots dehydrated and rehydrated in kombu, toasted garlic scapes, a “pate” from coral tossed with lobster tail meat|restaurants
Blows my mind how Leo manages to create all these dishes, the layering of flavours, textures, non conventional but all grounded in extracting max umami.|restaurants
Whole lobster tied tail to rostum a la L’Arpege and then steamed la minute to a perfect mi-cuit|restaurants
After shelling the tail and claws, he cut the tail and claws up into large chunks|restaurants
The frontal tails were roughly chopped up – with traces of green from its coral – like a tartare and placed this at the bottom of each plate|restaurants
The rest of the tail and claws were returned to the pot for one final steam prior to plating up, with all the residual juices also poured into the plate.|restaurants
Served with steamed onions and an illuminating non-sabayon of yolks cooked at 66degC with dashi and just a touch of raw ginger|restaurants
Low intervention, exceptionally healthy lobsters, and a phenomenal sauce with the rich flavour of yolks, light texture and the subtle ginger just tempers everything, leaving a clean finish|restaurants
Superb.|restaurants
You know this, one of Leo’s genius dishes, and one of my all time favourites|restaurants
Cod, coriander oil, potato noodles, so simple but utterly amazing – salt, the acidity, the sweetness and the textures, a dish that has it all.|restaurants
A little crisp topped with fresh, sweet scallops, salt, and a savoury nutella (hazelnut, cocoa, coconut, rice vinegar, etc) made in the morning by Leo|restaurants
A simple but sensational exercise of layers and texture!|restaurants
An amazing dish of tuna belly, cherries, asparagus with a lightly smoked horseradish cream and a ‘water’ of pimento|restaurants
Gently tingling the front of the palate, cooling sweetness and then the fat of the belly, a revelation by Renato, Leo’s right hand man here.|restaurants
I really liked Viajante when it was around, this is going back nearly a decade now, then latterly Taberna, both pushed out some delicious things for us Londoners, though both are now shut and superseded by Nuno’s other projects (Chiltern holding fort, Maos gaining steam, while it remains to be seen if Viajante 2.0 will ever rise from the ashes)|restaurants
Like anything of notable quality, it is always about the people and Mendes had the pick of the crop come through his kitchens (and still does at Maos)|restaurants
A few have gone on to make a name for themselves, I think mainly of Leo Carreira, and at least one guy has gone back home to open arguably one of the most exciting restaurants in Lisbon – Prado.|restaurants
And then of course, there’s Ana Gonçalves and Zijun Meng, the his and hers of TaTa Eatery, who have thus far garnered a sterling reputation for themselves, migrating from one residency to other across town|restaurants
I must admit, I tend not to bother so much with pop-ups these days, as they are by definition fleeting and not set up for consistency with the myriad of limitations|restaurants
But I’ve heard only good things about the pair’s ever improving offering, and with their latest residency looking as good as bricks & mortar, I thought it time to finally give it a go.|restaurants
Authenticity was much like a badge of honour when I started writing this blog (now going on 11 years), but these days, I like that its pretty much the norm for modern cuisine freely cross pollinating in pursuit an end goal of flavour, rather than simply pulling a five star replication of a classic recipe|restaurants
What remains the same however is a respect for classic technique and if anything it requires mastery of fundamental craft before you start riffing off new ideas (David Chang was on to something all those years ago).|restaurants
We now have chefs in Japan successfully applying French technique on local terroir, meanwhile in Europe, dashis are quickly replacing butter in the kitchens of many practitioners of classic cuisine|restaurants
Sure, I too admire the 80s golden age of Nouvelle masters (and still do, the last bastions L’Ambroisie and L’Arpege are still apex), much like now, those pioneering French chefs in their heyday also sought to break new ground in with minimalist and natural flavours, in place of heavy butter and roux|restaurants
Gastronomy moves forward as it always does, with the changing tastes of a new generation.|restaurants
So this melange and melting pot of cuisine is very much what Zijun and Ana are about|restaurants
East meets West, a marriage both in life and of cuisines, Portuguese and Chinese, and also everything else in between that interests them in pursuit of Deliciousness, and to create something that they can call their own.|restaurants
This is how I came away with my first brush with Meng’s food; Uniquely his own, with a lot of care in product procurement, attention to detail, technique in cooking and above all delicious food.|restaurants
Specifically for produce, Meng is keenly focused on his protein – both land and sea – with his specialty being atypically long length of dry ageing|restaurants
For meats, carcasses are hung for over 6 months at source, meanwhile he dry ages noble fish from the South West on premises in a dry fridge with salt slabs.|restaurants
I should speak about the major part of this site, it is first and foremost a cocktail bar, open by Alex Kratena, formerly of Artesian Bar, or most widely known as the World’s best bar|restaurants
The design is lovely with unbroken, smooth Scandi lines and it is split across two spaces|restaurants
The Elementary bit more casual, and the Tayer bit, hidden away at the back, and I suppose it entertains the more informed cocktail enthusiasts|restaurants
I drank two cocktails – and I’m hardly a mixed drink kind of guy – and both were excellent.|restaurants
Meng’s chef’s counter (and kitchen) resides in between the two spaces, and they pump out the all-day bar menu (the sando, the solders, flatbreads), and also this taster menu at the Chef’s counter, only available by booking directly with Meng and Ana, do it through|restaurants
As for the food; it sure is banging|restaurants
At his Chef’s counter, he prepares the food by himself and all dishes are whipped up a la minute|restaurants
It’s rather an intimate dining experience, and Meng delivers food that’s family style, soulful, familiar and comforting|restaurants
So much so, it actually masks the fact that he’s applied considerable craft make his cuisine.|restaurants
From the bar food menu, we asked for one of his now famous pork sandwich, with the breaded Iberico pork collar brined until lusciously moist and tende|restaurants
It is supremely well made katsu, brightened with a joltingly fresh sweet/savoury jam, the TaTa version of a tart katsu sauce|restaurants
Undoubtedly delicious, as London has already attested to, though I did feel that the crusty brioche to be a jarring contrast|restaurants
I get why he’s gone for a crusty bread, as this is in fact Meng’s take on Bifana, born from a collab dinner with Prado Restaurante early last year|restaurants
Personally, I think milk bread is the choice bread for a fully melt-in-your-mouth sandwich|restaurants
All about the soft textures, though that is more fittingly  Japanese in spiritm than a Portuguese sando|restaurants
Saying that, I get the hype, it is legit.|restaurants
One of the best new meals I had in London this year no question, TaTa is so much more than a simple reflection of the couple’s heritage|restaurants
I’m so happy for London! Don’t miss it, if like me, you’ve not yet experienced TaTa eatery till now, right now, it is gorgeous.|restaurants
We paid £149 for all food and drink for two|restaurants
The taster menu was £55pp, but actual price varies based on produce on the day|restaurants
Taster menu requires you to|restaurants
Like all good food, it starts firstly with product – here the Southwest’s most noble flat fish treated well|restaurants
Hung on premises in a dry fridge for five weeks, the turbot’s natural umami intensified, becoming round, mellow, complex, its textured softened and tightened, with the loss of moisture and the protein fibres gently denaturing from dry aging|restaurants
I included a video of @ana_357 dicing the turbot – the fillets positive glisten in the light|restaurants
Beautiful fish.|restaurants
The pickled kolrahbi is gentle rather than sharp, smooth, soft flavours to match that of the fish, resulting in mercurial balance.|restaurants
2|restaurants
200+day aged Dexter sirloin tartare, popped barley, wild strawberries, egg yolk and a dashi of mushroom with sesame, coriander and chilli oil.|restaurants
Meng talked about his sourcing of long aged protein while he prepared this dish, when his supplier rings him up about potentials, he trials a fillet after a standard 3 week hang time to taste first prior to purchasing|restaurants
Once he’s made up his mind on quality, he buys the carcass whole, and they hang it whole, for the long haul|restaurants
In this case over the 6month mark.|restaurants
The beef has tremendous flavour persistence but importantly, it hasn’t lost too much moisture, which undoubtedly is down to careful dry ageing|restaurants
To balance, he’s composed an earthy broth to match the grassy funk, popped barley for texture and wild strabs to pull in freshness and acidity|restaurants
It comes together like clockwork on the palate – a dance of richness and lightness|restaurants
The Chef has an instinctual palate, creating a taste that is both familiar and new at the same time|restaurants
Top notch.|restaurants
You might wonder about the two tartare dishes to start the taster menu, and partly this is because their grill isn’t fully in operation yet at these early days|restaurants
Right now, Meng relies on a single portable induction hob for source of heat|restaurants
The show must go on of course, as with any good chef, he’s resourceful and adapted his craft to suit his tools at hand|restaurants
Which is to say, there is even more to come when his grill gets up to speed 🔥!|restaurants
3|restaurants
First – the fattier end, as a sort of bossam, wrapped in purple komatsuna grown at Namayasai, with some spicy red bean paste.|restaurants
4|restaurants
Second – the loin end, with seaweed caramel, onion, shiso and sage flower, coriander stems and it is finished with a umami bomb sauce of garum made from trimmings from the iberico pork that goes in their sandos.|restaurants
The cuisson is perfect – edge to edge pink|restaurants
We saw him slowly roasting to, in a covered dry saucepan on his portable induction hob at low heat, occasionally poking holes in the skin|restaurants
Then prior to carving, Chef placed it skin side down on a hot pan|restaurants
Juicy like a water balloon, bags of flavour, melting tender, and the fat disintegrates like cotton candy on the palate|restaurants
Seasoned with salt and a superb spice mix consisting of cumin, coriander seeds, sesame, dried seaweed amongst other things, which acted to foil and contrast the fat.|restaurants
And of course, you’re well acquainted with this one – TaTa Eatery’s take on bifana|restaurants
With breaded iberico collar and toasted brioche in place of milk bread.|restaurants
This firm city favourite was born from a collab with Prado Restaurante|restaurants
I remember my meal there vividly during my Lisbon trip last year, as it was one of the best.|restaurants
Meng’s piece de resistance for this taster menu|restaurants
The dish that perhaps best signifies Meng and Ana’s cuisine a melding of Portuguese and Chinese, in this case Chinese steamed fish, and Portuguese coriander rice.|restaurants
The fish has been dry aged for 3 weeks, then is steamed la minute with ginger and fish sauce, on the bone and skin on|restaurants
When he pulled the spine out (swipe 👉), I was bowled over, a little translucency, a light pink blush on the spine|restaurants
Moist and shiny flesh pressed against the bones – this is perfect cuisson.|restaurants
The dry aging has tightened the flesh, giving the flakes both softness and a light firmness, steaming it like this accentuating the best attributes of its aged texture, whilst keeping it moist.|restaurants
It’s now been over a year since Alex Dilling took over the reigns from Arnaud Bignon, and what year it has been for this this charming little restaurant that has survived the decades with its series of chefs|restaurants
Alex has been working non-stop upping the ante with each passing season, and most recently was rewarded by the bib in maintaining the two star rating of afforded to Abela’s crowning glory since Bignon first won it in 2013.|restaurants
I’ve visited Alex about 5 – 6 visits in this past year since he took over and with each successive meal, I’ve observed the supremely talented Chef seemingly outdo himself at each turn, knocking out astounding and exciting dishes of true technical excellence that in my view makes him a legitimate recipient of a future third star|restaurants
Alongside Claude Bosi and Brett Graham, IMHO, these are the three guys currently sitting at the very apex of London gastronomy|restaurants
That is, if the guide awarded their stars based purely on the performance of the kitchen in that snapshot in time.|restaurants
If you have something to celebrate, you should certainly consider The Greenhouse, including the n25 aged caviar supplement when presented with the choice|restaurants
Photos and a few comments from my latest meal there.|restaurants
Just when I think these guys have set the bar, they find another way to level up, never resting on their laurels|restaurants
The craft involved blows my mind|restaurants
This dish – an entree and not pudding – actually works best as a surprise…|restaurants
….but if you need to know, then it is in fact tartare of Scotch lango with caviar|restaurants
One of my favourite classic combos, often presented in various guises by others (Passard’s nouvelle classic is one of my all time favourites), but none quite like this.|restaurants
It is encased in a set creme crue that’s soft, and somewhat gravity defying in keeping its perfectly spherical shape|restaurants
Served with an ultra clean apple and bergamot consommé, its freshness and acidity counterbalancing the cream and shellfish|restaurants
No modernist trickery here, just good old fashioned high level craft.|restaurants
Alex did mention that they are still tweaking the ratios (less cream, more caviar core), but as it stands, I think it’s already absolutely top notch stuff|restaurants
Simplicity, product quality, refinement, precision.|restaurants
With an onsen quail egg, thinly shaved matsutake, 18mo mimolette, jamon Iberico, watercress puree, a deep roast chicken jus|restaurants
The noble mushroom (this particular specimen being Canadian) now entering its last days of the season, but losing none of its distinct and unmistakable spicy, pine flavour which more than stands up to the mature cheese.|restaurants
Oh yeah my kind of sandwich, I loved this so much, being reflective of Alex’s approach as the core of his cuisine is all about unadulterated satisfaction.|restaurants
Such an elegant dish that is squarely about product and precision of cooking|restaurants
The trinity of flavours entirely marine, juicy grilled turbot with golden caramelisation, a satin smooth sauce imbued with oyster minerality, and the rich rush of creamy brine from the caviar… refinement and simplicity – my kind of fish course, loved it.|restaurants
Noble fish + caviar is a winning combo when done right imho|restaurants
And the key is the ratio for it to fly, like at L’Ambrosie or P53 and indeed as is this dish right here.|restaurants
8|restaurants
Hunter style Landes chicken with ceps, glazed boneless stuffed chicken wing, daikon salad roll, pomme souffle, and Alba white truffle.|restaurants
I’m certain you’ve already seen piccies of this elsewhere, and it does indeed taste every bit as epic as it looks 🌟🌟🌟|restaurants
The outermost chicken and Alsace bacon farci is soft all the way to the incredible crust; the detailing and the finishing of which simply astonishing|restaurants
The corrugated grill lines, the shiny glaze, the thyme and shiso flower adornments, and the seamless albufera sauce|restaurants
For me, the best white truffle dish of the season so far.|restaurants
I just had my “big spend” meal this year at the Clove Club (We limit £200+ a head meals to one or two a year) and i umm’d and ahh’d between CC, Greenhouse and a few others|restaurants
Now i see that chicken and croque madame dish im still wondering what i should have done|restaurants
Clove Club was fantastic though.|restaurants
I am so glad to finally see Endo san in his own digs|restaurants
I’ve been waiting 3 years since my first taste of Sushi Endo courtesy of|restaurants
‘s Hoxcup sake bar popup, and knew then that he had something very special to offer|restaurants
I love his style, makes sure punters have fun, feel good and masks the fact that he’s got killer tekkers and products up his sleeve – true hospitality flows through his veins.|restaurants
His menu doesn’t follow a strict Edomae sequence, in fact he starts with miso soup and diced 3-cut tuna and negi temaki before diving into nigiri|restaurants
And there I was bowled over|restaurants
To describe generally, Endo’s sushi is all about balance|restaurants
The sushi opens bright, finishes clean, umami peaks just as the textures dissipate into soft luxuriousness.|restaurants
To neta, gleaming ikejime Newlyn seabass (landed by Kernow) clean in flavour, and jelly-like in texture, served triple sliced; Ultra sweet English squid made with hundreds of cuts to fully tenderise; Scotch salmon smoked with Yamada-nishiki for 30s, more akin to subtle aburi than overt smoke, making the natural fish oil purr with savouriness|restaurants
Served with a little taste of Shuhari Ultra made from the same rice, top drawer|restaurants
The best was perhaps the scallop with Scherenkii – sweet, creamy briny umami, like Uni indeed!|restaurants
The Shari is airy and creamy, with a harmonious salt-vinegar ratio|restaurants
I didn’t ask for provenance, but inherent rice quality was clear|restaurants
He tweaks the temperature of the Shari to suit each neta|restaurants
Warmer for rich, body temp for white fish|restaurants
No eyeballing, he fires his IR gun to check – theatrical precision.|restaurants
On tuna, like his peers, Endo san uses Spanish farmed bluefin, based on a number of visits between late August and early November, he had procured lovely fish beginning to build up their fat reserves for the winter ahead|restaurants
My last visit there in early November, Endo san|restaurants
akami from a 200+kg Spanish maguro which he -alongside his supplier- had selected, cut, aged over ice for six days and trimmed down to the core for service|restaurants
I especially loved the chutoro, with fine strands of intramuscular marbling and a sweet flavour, foiled by the pure salt of his Shari|restaurants
Expect no less from the Yokohama native with generational ties to the vaunted maguro.|restaurants
The final bite, an ALC add-on (£6.5), was his humble seabream sandwich|restaurants
All elements made from scratch with attention paid to the tiniest details|restaurants
The tai is Cornish, and has been aged in kombu for a few days prior to being fried in panko|restaurants
The tartare sauce made with pickled ginger and garlic, it is topped with last of Oz winter truffles and finally, his milk bread is made in house.|restaurants
A banging meal all round|restaurants
The charismatic Chef thoroughly deserves the limelight, his sensationally choreographed menu, a wonderful performance taking place across his lavish Hinoki counter top.|restaurants
I am totally ecstatic for his well-deserved 🌟 he has earned for the 2020 guide|restaurants
The dinner menu is far from cheap, weighing in at £185|restaurants
It’s a ton of cash, but there is enough luxury products to justify it|restaurants
Otoh, his lunch omakase, priced at £60 (+ ALC topups) offers great value|restaurants
I’ve been there 4 times now, and I recommend you to start with the lunch|restaurants
The menu is shorter, but all the major sushi pieces make an appearance (including the chutoro and the salmon), so you won’t feel like you missed out|restaurants
If you do, you can still ALC a few extras pieces anyway|restaurants
Make this your next destination.|restaurants
A reflection of Endo san’s sushi heritage, his business card therefore is a temaki of 3 different cuts of tuna (Kama, toro and akami) and negi, warm nori (from same suppliers as Sushi Saito – but made to his own specs).|restaurants
A precious nigiri comprised of micro-seasonal and noble Autumn gear|restaurants
Canadian matsutake, white truffle, aburi Spanish otoro and sudaichi zest|restaurants
Absolutely top notch.|restaurants
Homemade Sandwich|restaurants
Kombu aged English tai, fried in panko wirh ginger garlic tartare sauce, last of Oz winter truffle and house made milk bread.|restaurants
I finally made it here and can genuinely say that I totally believe all the fanfare bandied around Christophe Pele’s gem in the house of Haut Brion|restaurants
His cuisine is one of modernity, subtlety and clarity|restaurants
Decidedly French with flourishes of Asian influence in a non-intrusive way (quite unlike say Barbot’s love of citrus-charged flavours), his lightness of touch across the dishes is inspired stuff and I find it extremely appealing.|restaurants
During lunch there are three choices of carte blanche menus, starting at 90euroes for a short 3 courses and going all the up to 190euroes for the six course menu Le Clarence|restaurants
In the evening, there is the epic 8 course which can be had for 320euroes|restaurants
I went for the 6 courses plus the white truffle supplement (60euroes), and arranged a little wine flight comprised of Haut Brion’s 2nd wines and their non first growth labels.|restaurants
Every course here is delivered as sequential multi-plates a la Gagnaire, and as a surprise|restaurants
In some regard, the spontaneity of Pele’s creative cuisine feels much like a grand version of Parisian bistronomy, played out in a most opulent setting|restaurants
I think it is every bit worthy of its two star rating and I would compare Pele’s idea of a carte blanche to that of Passage 53|restaurants
Both Chefs’ frame their menus around a string of balanced and light dishes that flow from the start to finish.|restaurants
What really makes Le Clarence rather unique of course are that you can opt for the HM and LMHB first wines – both the whites and the reds – by the glass, and indeed fashion a wine flight based around them|restaurants
They would still cost a ton, at 130 – 200 euroes a glass, but not thousands if you were to pop the cork on 4 bottles of each of the white and red Graves.|restaurants
Is it a candidate for 3 stars today? Probably not, as I feel that Pele is still tweaking his ideas about Cantonese flavours in his cuisine|restaurants
Also, a couple of docked points for presenting tourists with a sub-standard white truffle that is at the moment (mid Nov 2019) showing very well near its peak season|restaurants
However as it stands, his cuisine is very attractive, the cuisson is generally spot-on and I would love to revisit to see how he is progressing in due time.|restaurants
A light and fresh start, and all about textures, crunch of the filo, the dense fleshiness of the langoustine, and the softened bite of the pigs ears, tied together with a light chilli sauce that’s punches more with acidity than spice.|restaurants
Classic earth & sea combo, but the modern and light prep was to me a joy to eat|restaurants
The scallop is mi-cuit, and the kiss of the plancha infusing it with an all encompassing smokiness, lifted by the lactic creaminess of the buffalo milk.|restaurants
If the first way was lightness, this was to emphasise the scallop’s richer profile|restaurants
The flavour combinations here harmonious and complex, earthy sweetness, with the nutty, buttery richness of the tonato sauce, but carefully judged to not overwhelming the delicacy of the scallop’s natural sweetness.|restaurants
The first was seabass roasted skin side down|restaurants
Flourished with capucine flower, anchovy, tarvido radicchio that’s been gently rolled on the plancha, softening its mild bitterness , and an exceptional squid ink sauce that has lovely sweet-vinegar gastrique contrasting with the bitter-sweet of the endive and the fish’s umami|restaurants
A dish that seems so simple, but with everything so measured and so carefully cooked, it was dancing on the palate.|restaurants
The second, steamed shrimp bao on pumpkin purée; poached oyster with Jerusalem artichoke, beef broth and lemon|restaurants
While the seabass was superb, I actually enjoyed the second serving more|restaurants
The bao was very good indeed, the richness of shellfish melding especially well with the buttery, sweet and seamlessly smooth pumpkin purée – a successful marriage of French and Chinese flavours|restaurants
This was followed by a warm finish of classic beef and oysters.|restaurants
First was lacquered with soy sauce and the cuisson on this was phenomenal, wobbly and the perfect shade of light pink in the centre|restaurants
with beurre blanc and daurenki wrapped in spinach and lightly toasted on the pan|restaurants
Joyfully elegant and precise cooking.|restaurants
The second was battered and deep fried, KFC sweetbreads on top of a very airy, whipped sabayon that was subtly sweet, I’m guessing with a little Madeira drizzled in.|restaurants
The mains in three plates, with Alba truffle, paired with a glass of HB’s 2nd wine, the Le Clarence from 07|restaurants
Clockwise from the centre:|restaurants
Slick cooking on the quail, accompanied by rich flavours both with the parm drizzled ravioli, and the squid ink sauce, which I believe is made with some of the gizzards folded in, giving rise to a meatier sauce, as compared to the much lighter version that came with the seabass.|restaurants
Although, my favourite component was the eel -which IMHO easily rivals good Kansai style unagi- and the pairing with lightly cooked foie gras melting into the sweet savoury glaze was absolutely delicious.|restaurants
The only downer perhaps was the white truffle itself|restaurants
Not the best example, a little dry with its aromatic powers waning, and unable to keep pace with the array of flavour across the plates.|restaurants
Cigar of lemon cream, homemade (and extremely light) waffles with a beautiful chestnut syrup (like liquid marron glace) and stiff vanilla chantilly.|restaurants

2016|restaurants
Done|restaurants
To you, dear reader, who continue to read blogs in 2016, thank you very much|restaurants
Have a jolly Christmas and New Years, eat and drink till you drop and see you in 2017.|restaurants
Small and beautiful situated in leafy Holland Park – a change from exciting East London prospects – and only newly trading since Spring|restaurants
The team are mostly an exodus of Terroir alumni, led out West by owner Oli Barker (after he split from the Terroirs group)|restaurants
In the kichen, Pascal Weidemann lays on a simple yet decidedly considered menu using good ingredients – both raw and preserved – and cooked with heart and soul|restaurants
Exactly the sort of thing that is conjured, when you think of hidden gems.|restaurants
I remain a big fan of Phil Howard, initially shocked that he decided to sell The Square, but now glad that Elystan Street has got off to a flying start|restaurants
The price tag attached to the dinner menu looks a little scary, but that is why you should drop in for lunch|restaurants
I for one am keen on his Sunday roasts, from what I’ve|restaurants
Two visits in the first couple of weeks trading showed that Phil has lost none of his ability|restaurants
He may be actively paring down his cuisine, but it is inevitable that the old Square magic will leak through|restaurants
Like this smoked mackerel dish for example, a simplification of his 2012 GBM winner|restaurants
?% deliciousness.|restaurants
I am pleasantly surprised by the quality from this restaurant attached to a salvage yard|restaurants
Led by chefs Jackson Boxer and Andrew Clarke, they have crafted a constantly changing menu, sensitive to seasons and unshackled from tradition|restaurants
Priced incredibly well, all the while delivering tasty food inside an interesting decor of mostly reconditioned trinkets|restaurants
I have visited 5 times in the last quarter, each meal something different and each bite a delight, like the above pairing of texturally exciting chopped bavette with a puree from blitzed mussels.|restaurants
The keen eye amongst you will recognise the rather swish table and chairs that were part of the maligned Aizpitarte project, Le Chabannais|restaurants
Now in a better foster home I think.|restaurants
This is the Bib’s pick for pub of the year and I think is a fully deserving accolade, if not also a full star to be restored to the co chef-owners, Tom Harris and Jon Rotherham, both ex-St John Hotel.|restaurants
Of puddings this year, the brown butter and honey tart is hands down my favourite|restaurants
From the impossibly thin architecture of the pastry base to the gravity defying wobble of the custard – exacting and sensational patisserie|restaurants
It tastes great too.|restaurants
They are a little understaffed for the moment, and turn over an incredible number of tables on Sundays, so just be wary that you may end up with an inconsistent meal|restaurants
When they have the time to be on their game however, all of it is straight fire.|restaurants
I love Paris for gastronomy and bistronomy and in 2016, I think they (still) do it better than we do in London, on both sides of the bank|restaurants
Of the ones that stood out for me was without question Hideki Nishi’s Summer Snow|restaurants
The ex-Taillevent Chef works with the best of French produce, applying precision classic technique with just the right dose of Japanese heritage|restaurants
Like this beautiful pork loin, grilled on the bone over Japanese bincho coals|restaurants
SO delicious|restaurants
I wouldn’t be surprised if Nishi san gets promoted by the Bib sometime in the near future|restaurants
For me, it is a restaurant I must include on every trip to Paris.|restaurants
One of my all time favourites in The Smoke|restaurants
David O’Connor and Joe Mercer-Nairn’s restaurant turned 5 this year, and is as strong as ever|restaurants
The bib may have forsaken them, baffling because dishes like above stand head and shoulders above some starred restaurants in town|restaurants
Although the lack of a star is probably a blessing in disguise|restaurants
Five years on, it is still the best money (£35 for 3) you can spend anywhere for a decent lunch in London|restaurants
If you have never been, now is the time to make it happen.|restaurants
I’ve been a Lee Westcott fan since his head chef days for Tom Aikens (at Elystan Street)|restaurants
And like Tom, this guy is quite the gifted chef, able to finesse seemingly humble ingredients into higher planes, through modernist methods as well as the naturalism of New Nordic to deliver a solid idea of what Modern British cuisine ought to look like|restaurants
This Spring expression of Devon crab for instance simply dances on the palate|restaurants
Where is the bib on him, I wonder.|restaurants
And indeed it was, delivered across two plates|restaurants
First, as roasted tail to a perfect mi-cuit and secondly with its knuckles folded into a ravioli|restaurants
Both with full-flavoured bisques, each distinctly spiced from the other|restaurants
I visited twice, the first was a Bretagne blue, the second a Cornish blue|restaurants
Both times were fantastic|restaurants
A little more than the lo-key brasserie image I think|restaurants
The Chef is one Rapheal Grima, from the two meals I ate here, this guy looks serious about making Les110 a splash in London|restaurants
At these prices and for this sort of execution, I’ll gladly eat live native lobsters in its own stock all day long|restaurants
Two more please.|restaurants
Even more fun than it looks|restaurants
Tucked away in a North West London pub is the talented Jesse Dunford Wood and whilst his standard menu at the pub is more than decent, it is his Chef’s table that’s special|restaurants
For £70pp, Jesse will feed you, and feed you, tell you some stories, display his sabrage skills and finish the show with a nod/wink to that other guy who also worked for Charlie Trotter, or a dessert bar in Hong Kong depending on where you read it first.|restaurants
This probably qualifies as one of the most delicious things London has to offer|restaurants
Available on Saturdays mornings only|restaurants
The rest of the menu is just as gorgeous and expectedly so since it is Stevie Williams (Ex-Harwood Arms Head Chef) who does the heavy lifting here.|restaurants
San Francisco’s finest via St John Bread and Wine and mad love for Kiss|restaurants
Nothing is what it seems, which is what makes Lee Tiernan’s Mission North London such a genius turn|restaurants
Leave the earplugs at home and order everything on the menu.|restaurants
I can’t exactly say I enjoy every thing Mikael Jonsson puts on a plate, but I do return every year and respect the risks he continues to take in polishing his cuisine year on year|restaurants
I have to say I was bowled over by this crab dish, one reason why I thought the meal at Hedone this year was several notches above last year’s|restaurants
Such purity of flavour, such respect for the ingredients – two types of crab Devon cock and (invisible) tiny velvet swimmer crab – something like this has to be cooked a la minute with absolutely the freshest and best you can get your hands on|restaurants
The result is perfection|restaurants
Perhaps the clearest representation of Mikael’s style of cuisine I’ve yet tasted|restaurants
Like Medlar, Hedone also celebrates 5 years in the business, whilst gaining an international profile along the way|restaurants
Quite some work Mikael and Aurelie have achieved in this time.|restaurants
Challans duck, aged in-house for 21 days, roasted whole and showed at the table|restaurants
While it disappears into the kitchen to be carved…|restaurants
Perfect duck|restaurants
Definitely one of the best in memory|restaurants
Meals like this explain why Isaac Mchale is doing as well as he is in 2016.|restaurants
Kayabaki eel in Japan can be broadly classified into two styles that relate to preparation and cooking method|restaurants
Kanto/East/Tokyo style slits open the wriggler from the back, and the cooking process includes a steaming step, in addition to skewering, grilling and finishing with sweet tare sauce over bincho charcoal.|restaurants
Where as the Kansai/West/Osaka style slits from belly (like ‘harakiri’ and because Samurais are mostly in Kanto) and the cooking skips the steaming, and therefore leads to crispier skin, like crackling, generally a better ‘sealing effect’.|restaurants
The latter is sometimes referred to as being the more masculine style, the meat is firmer and more robust, more flavour, as it has not been softened by a steaming step.|restaurants
I’m hardly the unagi expert, but I’m willing to take a punt and suggest that Umu’s unagi is prepped Kanto style, but grilled Kansai style|restaurants
This I speculate is due in part to Chef Yoshinori Ishii’s training, beginning in Osaka and then moving on to the revered Kitcho in Kyoto.|restaurants
For me, this is an incredible take on British freshwaters and one in which Ishii san has applied his considerable talents to adapt his cuisine to local produce, not to mention his efforts in bringing ikejime to the shores of Cornwall.|restaurants
It costs an arm and leg (as it does in Japan), but it is absolutely worth sampling this, especially for ALC (£32 for eel + £8 for a bowl of rice, which you need)|restaurants
Meaty, fleshy, full of natural oiliness, comprehensively unctuous|restaurants
Undoubtedly the best unagi I have had outside of Japan and unbelievably, this is unique to Britain because of the native eel|restaurants
Reasons why he holds a brace of stars.|restaurants
Celebrating Game season at Bonhams this year was magnificent, taming the rich flavours of wild birds with a confit and roast technique that produced a fine expression of British Terroir|restaurants
In|restaurants
, Woodcock breast,leg, head and heart with White Alba truffles, salt baked Jerusalem artichokes and pickled elderberries was truly the pièce de résistance.|restaurants
My favourite new restaurant in 2015 is now my firm favourite in London|restaurants
I think I’m on my 14th visit and each meal better than the last|restaurants
Intensely seasonal produce is the point, with the Chef intervening to deliver maximum natural flavour|restaurants
It takes quite some skill to do simplicity and in Chef Tom Kemble and sous Theo Clench, we have a cuisine that excels in the classy, subtle and delicate.|restaurants
Nobody can predict what the Red Guide does anymore, though FWIW, I think these guys are on a trajectory towards Two Michelin Stars|restaurants
I’ve been watching very closely|restaurants
The future of British Gastronomy, here and now.|restaurants
Simon Bonwick won a fresh star this year and I think he totally deserves it|restaurants
Amazingly he works alone in his kitchen and yet he turns out plate after plate of proper delight with classical precision|restaurants
A mere £25 for a menu choisi consisting five courses.|restaurants
His son Dean runs front of house like a champ, and if you take a look at Father and Son’s combined resume, you will understand why their family restaurant is as solid as it is|restaurants
A true practitioner of gastronomy and for these exact reasons, I think it deserves to sit at the top of my modest heap in 2016.|restaurants
My pick for 2016 is Anglo restaurant|restaurants
Opened by Chef-owner Mark Jarvis with head chef Jack Cashmore and FOH led by Nick Gilkinson.|restaurants
In a year which is again heavy on casual, concept-driven openings, it is refreshing to come across the ambition behind Anglo|restaurants
It reminds me very much of Clove Club’s beginning days (Upstairs at Ten Bells to be exact), Chris John’s Antidote and also Merlin Labron-Johnson’s (also ex-In de Wulf) Portland.|restaurants
A cuisine that is driven by British products, offered in a stripped down equilibrium of modern and classic, with interesting pairings here and there, and accurate balancing of flavours|restaurants
The price point is pretty delicious too|restaurants
It’s a good thing going and I do hope they continue to strive for improvement.|restaurants
I have been blogging about restaurants since 2008 and to date have served 33 million page views|restaurants
I started this as a hobby to fill the downtime whilst on assignment in Wales|restaurants
I slowed down considerably in 2013-2015 mainly to purchase and then to refurb our house|restaurants
We|restaurants
I keep this blog primarily because it helps me track what I’ve been fortunate enough to eat|restaurants
I am mindful that you are my modest occasional readership and I apologise for putting you through the thousands of typos, factual errors and a totally unhindered word count|restaurants
I continue to learn about food and ways to communicate ideas about it with each new post.|restaurants
Gastronomy is vast, rooted in tradition, yet ever changing with the seasons, and it will take decades to experience its greatest examples|restaurants
It fascinates me as I hope to be able to separate the timeless from trend, understand how palates change with age and why people react to it in such different ways.|restaurants
My father was the original admirer of restaurants, through his own quest to taste the best from all over|restaurants
He planned most of our family holidays around his hunt for the perfect steamed garoupa, convinced it is a matter of timing and the all important catch.|restaurants
His love for food stems from his father’s life as a pastry chef and then restaurant owner in 1960s colonial Brunei|restaurants
He spent most of his working life perfecting creme brulee and french toast in our tiny seaside town of Kuala Belait|restaurants
Reasons why my dad still grins like a Cheshire cat whenever he comes across a decent egg based pudding.|restaurants
I’m no judge merely an observer and mostly just somebody who loves to eat|restaurants
I hope you find this blog useful and entertaining in equal measure.|restaurants
I would like to invite you to a private Chefs table at Dim t in London|restaurants

Aged Belted Galloway fillet, slow braised shortrib, smoked marrow, salt baked turnip, padron puree, garlic cream and jus gras|restaurants
Brett Graham has been consistently on top form for at least the last five years, and most of his dishes have become quite iconic, and also rooted in his seasonal repertoire|restaurants
But this year in 2017, I think he’s managed to find reinvention and further refinement in his cooking|restaurants
Minor but significant tweaks to his perfect dishes, here and there, and all of it stacks up to something rather quite spectacular|restaurants
For me, The Ledbury is the yardstick for Modern Gastronomy in London, fundamentals, handling of quality seasonal produce and the hallmark Front of House that walks the line of casual-slickness|restaurants
For me, The Ledbury is the best of 2017.|restaurants
And that’s it|restaurants
Next year will be a full decade which I been doing this|restaurants

When people ask me what piece of kit I have in my kitchen that I love and would recommend, there are a few contenders|restaurants
Firstly, every home cook just needs to start with a good knife, a wooden spoon, a chopping board and a heavy pan|restaurants
Beyond this, I rely heavily on my mixer, food processor and my pressure cooker.|restaurants
A pressure cooker was not something that I thought that I would ever want|restaurants
As with many people I have terrifying memories of pressure cookers that seemed to hiss and dance and threaten to explode|restaurants
The veg cooked inside – always veg – were limp and lifeless|restaurants
The flavour all gone with the hiss and the steam scream, leaving pale carrot batons and burst potatoes.|restaurants
It was 17C in London today|restaurants
In FEBRUARY|restaurants
That is completely bonkers|restaurants
Still, it is February, so soup weather|restaurants
I lightened this one a bit, basing it in a light garlicky broth with beans (chickpeas, but use whatever bean you like), streaky bacon, crumbled sausage, cavolo nero, a pinch of chilli and a twist on gremolata on top.|restaurants
Let’s talk about gremolata! I love it and it is perfect for brightening things, especially anything meaty, like a rich slow cooked ragu|restaurants
It is simply lemon zest, flat leaf parsley and raw garlic|restaurants
Chopped and chopped and chopped together, until really fine|restaurants
I said this was a twist, and so it was|restaurants
I used preserved lemon and added some chilli also|restaurants
It really lifted the bowl.|restaurants
I know this looks dark and messy, but truly, aren’t many of the best things? I love crispy beef and I love black bean sauce|restaurants
I am working on a gluten-free version of crispy beef which makes no compromises|restaurants
It is almost there! For now, my speedy black bean sauce is good to go, so I will share it with you now.|restaurants
I use Chinese salted fermented black beans which are a cupboard essential for me|restaurants
You can get these in any Chinese food store, usually in small plastic bags or a yellow cardboard tub|restaurants
Fermented foods are a way of borrowing time from before and adding fast flavour|restaurants
How lovely is that? I soaked the beans briefly and then simply blitzed all of the ingredients together, then cooked it for 10 minutes|restaurants
Done!|restaurants
Once you start making taramasalata, you can’t go back|restaurants
It is so delicious, so fast and easy to make and much more economical to make at home|restaurants
It takes minutes and provides so much pleasure.|restaurants
Most taramasalatas are lightened with bread, but on my current gluten-free diet I have been playing around and adding lots of different things to my tarama|restaurants
Don’t be horrified, these are just as delicious and sufficiently different to be very interesting|restaurants
I still love the original of course, and fondly remembered trips to Greece are my inspiration|restaurants
If only I had the sea lapping nearby as an accompaniment!|restaurants
Tarama means salted and cured cod roe, that being the egg sack of the fish|restaurants
It is luscious and rich and is used to great effect in many food cultures, notably Japanese cuisine|restaurants
In Japan cod and pollock roe are cured with chilli and called mentaiko|restaurants
The colour is bright red and it is the perfect partner to many things|restaurants
I love mentaiko in Japanese fusion dishes like Mentaiko Mac and Cheese|restaurants
My friend Luiz Hara has|restaurants
Eating out in Ireland can be a little difficult when you can’t have dairy|restaurants
It is entirely possible and people are of course very accommodating. On an island of farmers and in a food culture devoted to all things butter milk and cream, it has felt in recent years like I have been missing a lot.|restaurants
On an island of rich green fields and all that rain we have terrific dairy products across the board. Wonderful artisanal farmhouse cheeses, terrific milk and cream, buttermilk is for sale everywhere that sells milk and by the litre|restaurants
Our soda bread is milk based, many things are|restaurants
We are obsessed with butter, we even put it on our biscuits.|restaurants
Cork has a rich dairy history|restaurants
It was once home to the most important butter market in the UK and Ireland|restaurants
Launched in 1730, at its peak in the 1880s it was handling 500,000 casks of butter per year valued at £1.5million|restaurants
People travelled from all over the world to Cork to trade butter. It is for this reason that there are recipes like Spiced Beef in Cork as the spices were traded for butter|restaurants
It closed later as European butter markets competed, and in the area where it once thrived there is now Cork Butter Museum|restaurants
A curious small place packed with butter paraphernalia and history including an ancient barrel of bog butter|restaurants
Butter was our primary source of fat and therefore stored energy for the lean months of winter|restaurants
We are still obsessed.|restaurants
Cork is a small city by international standards but it is Ireland’s second city, it is also in Ireland’s largest county|restaurants
The gastronomy scene is exciting and it has been developing at speed and with confidence|restaurants
Cork as with much of Ireland has coastline and rich pasture and it is packed with passionate producers and chefs making the most of the gorgeous tapestry available to them.|restaurants
8|restaurants
Jeremy presents his piece de résistance, rack of 5 year old sheep, slowly grilled whole, and as you can see, it’s mighty fine kit.|restaurants
at Crocadan farm, and the quality is something of a revelation|restaurants
The cap of fat is both full in its honey gold in colour as well as in flavour, signs of its healthy diet of grass|restaurants
Meanwhile the meat is notably tender, and well marbled, with a rather pure and subtly sweet flavour|restaurants
Jeremy remarked later that it is for this reason, he see potential to push the dry age and develop its flavour|restaurants
In terms of the cook, I really love the crispy and rendered fat, gorgeous, and I thought he chose the right temperature of meat (if I had to guess, I’d say 120F?) for natural flavour, with zero juice loss.|restaurants
The sauce is coffee and shito, which they described as analogous to sambal, and like anchovy to lamb, this sauce harmonised beautifully with the sheep|restaurants
For acidity, a purée of mandarin and sweet potato also graced the plate.|restaurants
Of course, the other of Ikoyi’s icon dishes, the smoked rice with the crab custard makes an appearance too|restaurants
Served with the mains, family style, meat and rice what’s not to love|restaurants
A crowd favourite I’m sure, I too love this, beautiful recipe, the savouriness simply brings a smile to my face.|restaurants
Wild rice ice cream with a biscuit tuile made from Senegalese grass called fonio and excellent “chewy” mangoes that were dehydrated seeped in oil then rehydrates in honey|restaurants
Amazing, well balanced pudding.|restaurants
Fantastic rice|restaurants
Laden with savouriness, laced with smoke and spiciness, while subtle does build continuously 9and considerably) with each spoonful|restaurants
Couldn’t stop myself from making scoop after scoop after…|restaurants
I am very excited to see fish head appear more regularly on London menus these days, because all the best bits are here! The cuisson is spot on, all the gelatinous bits sliding off the bone, and given the rich natural flavours, the spices do amazing things to temper it|restaurants
I’d go as far to say it’s the best fish head I’ve had in London|restaurants
Comes close to many childhood memories of fish head curries back home.|restaurants
Good cook on the tranche, juicy and moist, on the bone or whole is the best way to cook turbot or any fish without question|restaurants
I did have just some minor niggles as personally, I would have preferred skin on (rather than off) as there’s a lot of flavour (and gelatinous fat) there, and also prefer it was pulled just a few degreeC cooler, for a slight blush of pink in the bones (to borrow Passard’s “hot-raw”,|restaurants
Never had Nigerian cuisine before, I don’t have a reference point for the spices, so to me, the aromas definitely interest the palate|restaurants
The turbot tranche was served with an aromatic squid ink sauce, but given the potency, it did overwhelm as I worked into the dish|restaurants
I think it needs just some more salt and a touch of acidity for balance|restaurants
Though it didn’t detract from the overall epicness of this spread of Turbot|restaurants
Who needs a tasting menu when this noble fish is served like this for £60.|restaurants
(Moan as much as you like about the prices but River Cafe (and T Randall) do very good versions of Turbot tranche in their wood fire oven too)|restaurants
I love it when multiple cuts appear, hope more Chefs do this, it’s like a throwback to assiette days, and what dining out ought to be about.|restaurants
As for the taste… it is perfection|restaurants
Of course, the pork itself is of notable quality, undoubtedly the Agu from the southern most isle of Japan, a short hop to Taipei|restaurants
It is naturally tender with sweet subtle flavour|restaurants
To the cuisson, wipe away the crust of rice, and you’re greeted with magnificent edge to edge sakura pink, glistening pork, with zero moisture/juice loss|restaurants
A fantastic meat course, an altogether racy experience.|restaurants
As with Logy, the team is seen at the end of lunch service, starting the meats on the pan for the dinner service|restaurants
To colour, prior to a slow roast to achieve the consistent edge to edge pink across the meat.|restaurants
I didn’t hesitate to pick up his book while there, simply titled “Cuisson de la Viande” (Meat cookery), which gives some insight to his timings and temp for various meats, incl lean game, all via classic technique, without ever seeing the water bath|restaurants
His knowledge of meat is unsurprising given his background as Shuzo Kishida’s right hand man at Quintessence, famed for his laborious alternating high/fast heat and long rest technique.|restaurants
I am old fashioned and I admire the craft of meat cookery, while there are a few masters out there, Brett Graham and Alain Passard are my heroes in the slow, multi-stage processes they use to raise their proteins|restaurants
After my visits to Florilege/Logy, Clan Kawate is my latest|restaurants
World class meat cookery.|restaurants
Chocolate omelette with espresso sauce and fresh chantilly, aka “The Gift”, and its significance is the chocolate is made from Amazonian cacao imported directly from a Peruvian village.|restaurants
To the craft of it, it is rather accurate and remarkable as this is chocolate omelette in the true sense|restaurants
The pastry chef can been seen pouring the chocolate mix into a little copper pan to shake, stir, tap, tilt, fold and flip|restaurants
Exactly the way I’m sure you do your perfect French omelette every Sunday morning|restaurants
Glazed with espresso sauce instead of butter.|restaurants
It’s very delicate, spoon goes in and it reveals the baveuse centre, as you would expect of a decent three egg omelette|restaurants
In terms of taste, it is more akin to a chocolate fondant, but it is notably light and the chocolate being rather purer in taste rather than rich, with fresh cream keep things light.|restaurants
Carpaccio slices of raw squid, karasumi, compressed stalk of native spinach|restaurants
Topped with ice plant, goats yoghurt jus – Taiwanese terroir, and banging.|restaurants
The bowl is piping hot, and so too the consommé which is reheated in the saucepan and then poured at the table over the egg pudding, piping hot|restaurants
A perfectly timed chawanmushi that is seamless and silkened, a classic pairing with crab, and the Goji berries – it’s unmistakable herb & light tang flavours – grounding the dish in its native terroir.|restaurants
Then, the chaud-froid effect takes hold, itself reinforced by the smart pairing of flavours|restaurants
The herb-root ice cream contrasting with the warm umami flavours, a sort of tension and a rush of the senses, alongside the melt in your mouth textures.|restaurants
I love chawanmushi/royales of all forms as it is vogue in modern menus these days|restaurants
This one sits high on the list of like for likes in recent memory as this is both delicious and creative|restaurants
Banging dish.|restaurants
Comte, lily root gnocchi (v good), chewy sweet corn meringue, and frozen foie scented with lavender|restaurants
Paired with a Jura VJ.|restaurants
This was entirely illuminating – it appears conceptual, abstract on the visuals, but on the palate, the sauces combine to amazing effect, engaging all four tastes, with appealing overall umami, but nothing overpowers|restaurants
A touch of the salty bonito is tempered by the freshness of the coconut, the bitter of the aubergine balanced by the sweetness of the chocolate, meanwhile the onions prop up the palate with acidity and so it goes, sinusoidal waves of pleasure.|restaurants
The eel on its own is cooked wonderfully, juicy in the centre, and Tahara san can be seen refrying them just prior to plating, so it’s crispy enough to stand up to the curry-thick sauce, the comfort / satisfaction levels are sky high|restaurants
Top notch dish.|restaurants
Steamed brown croaker (boned and rolled), clam and pig ear sauce, native vine leave and a froth of nage, shiitake and saffron.|restaurants
Tahara san’s pièce de résistance for this meal: 100 day old White Roman Goose from Tainan, free range and finished on a diet of barley.|restaurants
Tahara san is a man after my own heart, he abstains from the water bath, instead favours good old fashioned multi-stage direct heat for his proteins.|restaurants
He starts by firstly scoring the crown, then into the pan for colour|restaurants
Though left unsaid when they presented the crown to diners, I’ve no doubt the goose has been air dried, since the skin is immaculately clean and glistens in the light|restaurants
Then, I presume it goes under low and slow heat (for hours?), then rested, though I didn’t see this part with my own eyes.|restaurants
Prior to plate-up, Tahara san is seen whipping the breasts off the crown and sticking them back in the pan – skin side down to crisp up|restaurants
He then slices and seasons each slice|restaurants
The resulting goose breast is a perfect edge to edge pink, juicy and moist, with crispy skin, and a thin cap of rendered, tasty fat|restaurants
It is a big old bird, so it has a little natural chew but comes with bags of natural flavour.|restaurants
The ode to Taiwanese terroir is ever present in the dish, the goose is paired with potatoes made into a light bloodcake (a nod to the famed Taiwanese street food), and topped with charred Yilan famous “3 star” chives|restaurants
The duck jus is made with white port and Shao Xing wine.|restaurants
As we winded down for puds, Tahara san starts the goose for the evening sitting on the pan; a good 4hours prior to dinner service, which is how I got the videos.|restaurants

The restaurant scene was just beginning to stir and, with great difficulty, a hundred people were persuaded to take part in the first London-wide survey|restaurants
For nine months before publication of the first edition of Hardens London Restaurants, Richard and Peter ate their way around the capital: between them the brothers consumed 600 meals out in a six-month period.|restaurants
Twenty four years later, and the number of participants has increased sixty-fold|restaurants
Yes, thats 60 times more than Hardens first guide with over 6,250 people casting their votes for the latest editions!|restaurants
Richard Harden originally conceived the concept of Harden’s Guides (as the business was originally called) in 1991, and has been instrumental in the development of the business in partnership with his brother Peter Harden ever since.|restaurants
Having been involved in Harden’s for nearly a quarter of a century, Richard now feels it is time to apply his wide-ranging experience of business, and especially the publishing and catering sectors, to new challenges|restaurants
Richard will remain a material shareholder in the company.|restaurants
Richard says: “My brother Peter has always been at the forefront of adapting the business as circumstances change and opportunities arise, and I am sure it will continue to thrive with only one Harden at the helm.”|restaurants

For the fifth year, the Sunday Times today publishes the ‘Food List’ – the top 100 UK restaurants for food|restaurants
This supplement is published in association with Harden’s, and based on the our annual survey of restaurant-goers.|restaurants
For 2015 there’s been a serious shakeup, with last year’s top three – Gidleigh Park, Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles and the Yorke Arms – making way for a new top trio of dining destinations|restaurants
The survey crowns eccentric chef Marc Wilkinson’s Oxton restaurant, FraÃ®che (pictured), as the home of the UK’s best cooking|restaurants
Alone in his kitchen, Wilkinson creates show-stopping tasting menus demonstrating contemporary techniques that would make the Fat Duck pale in comparison.|restaurants
Second is that bastion of classic gastronomy (and home of everyone’s favourite Frenchman, Raymond Blanc) – Le Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons in Great Milton|restaurants
Rounding out the top three is Simon Rogan’s L’Enclume in Cartmel – he may have branched out to Manchester and London’s Claridge’s Hotel – but his original, rural ‘restaurant with rooms’ is still the spiritual home for his style of all-natural, local cuisine.|restaurants
Ever fancied being a restaurant critic? When you take part in Harden’s                                         annual survey you get the chance to comment on your best (and worst)                                         dining experiences across the country, scoring restaurants for food,                                         service and ambience|restaurants

Desserts are homey as well, from hand-cranked, seasonal ice cream paired with sheet cake to gooey butter cake topped with seasonal fruit like rosemary roasted peaches.|restaurants
The sun is shining, the temperature is heating up and cravings for summery classics like fried chicken are at an all-time high, making it an apt time to round up some of Chicago’s finest variations of this all-American specialty|restaurants
From new dishes to timeworn favorites, here’s where to get your fix right now.|restaurants
Feed: While many restaurants and hot spots and newcomers throughout the city peddle buzzy interpretations of fried chicken, Feed has been perfecting the comfort food formula for years|restaurants
The frills-free, Southern-inspired eatery in Humboldt Park is still among the best destinations for chicken in any form in Chicago|restaurants
The rotisserie chicken is a popular go-to, but don’t shy away from the fried birds either, especially the dark meat portions|restaurants
If you’re really feeling hungry, order the 1/2 chicken with two sides, with savorous options like corn pudding, fried okra, succotash, potato salad and mac & cheese.|restaurants
Chicken & Farm Shop: Nestled inside Soho House Chicago, you’ll find a pastoral restaurant capable of transporting you and your senses to the English countryside|restaurants
Decked out like a sunny, serene cottage, Chicken & Farm Shop knows a thing or two about comfort in all forms|restaurants
In addition to the heartwarming ambience, that notion is evident in the menu offerings too|restaurants
As the name suggests, chicken is king here, and the kitchen has a particular penchant for frying|restaurants
Nuggets, sandwiches and buttermilk battered chicken and waffles are all on hand, offering different takes on the staple.|restaurants
The Roost: Armed with a food truck and some family recipes, North Carolina native Joe Scroggs began a fried chicken revolution in Chicago when he took his fiery fried chicken recipe to the streets on his popular food truck|restaurants
In 2012, The Roost branched out well beyond its food truck roots and into a  restaurant space at the northern tip of Lakeview, serving signature hot or herb-seasoned fried chicken with buttermilk biscuits and peach cobbler.|restaurants
: When one of the most acclaimed restaurants in the world opens a restaurant with fried chicken as a star attraction, it’s safe to assume that it’s going to be above-average chicken, to say the least|restaurants
The folks behind Alinea put fried chicken in a whole new spotlight at Roister, where the humble comfort food ascends to glorious new levels|restaurants
The highly Instagrammable dish is part of a multi-step whole-chicken preparation that’s served with sunchokes and chamomile, and there’s also a more casual fried chicken sandwich that gets a punch of sunchoke hot sauce and some fragrant chamomile mayo.|restaurants
: Chicago’s mighty fried chicken pioneers are still at the top of their poultry game, as Avodnale’s Honey Butter Fried Chicken still draws crowds of hungry customers to its casual eatery every day of the week that it’s open|restaurants
The popularity and hype is legit|restaurants
The boneless, locally sourced chickens are fried until golden brown, then served as a platter of breasts, drumsticks and thighs, or in alternative options like sandwiches, mac & cheese, nachos, French toast and tacos|restaurants
In case it wasn’t clear, this is fried chicken heaven|restaurants
Then there’s the namesake honey butter, which gilds the lily as a sweet and creamy topping to any and all fried chicken creations.|restaurants
: When most people think of Tex-Mex, be it classic and no-frills or totally neoteric and adventurous, they think of enchiladas and tacos and tequila|restaurants
Fried chicken may not be the most obvious go-to, but it fits in well at Dove’s Luncheonette, which does a top-notch job with clever Tex-Mex in Wicker Park|restaurants
A nod to chicken-fried steak, a Texas staple, the chicken-fried chicken was an instant hit at the sunny restaurant, and it remains as fiendishly popular as ever|restaurants
That’s thanks to the comforting combo of buttermilk fried chicken and creamy, spicy chorizo verde gravy|restaurants
The heaping plate gets a welcome dose of brightness and sweetness thanks to peas and pearl onions.|restaurants
: Seafood gets top billing at this familial, nautically inspired Lincoln Park haunt, but you’d remiss to skim over the fried chicken, which is a real sleeper hit on the expansive menu|restaurants
The rendition here contains a hulking portion of crispy chicken seasoned with Old Bay spices, served with sides of cole slaw and fries|restaurants
Those spices are key, adding just the right mix of heat and herbs|restaurants
For those looking for fried chicken at home, the restaurant also offers the same chicken to-go from its adjoining carryout and delivery concept, Seaside’s.|restaurants
Summer in Chicago is the best time of year to dine with a waterside view overlooking sea-sized Lake Michigan, drinking in the panoramic views as you simultaneously drink wine, cocktails and beer|restaurants
Whether it’s a skyscraper-sized view or a casual cafe, these are some of your best options for beachy views and waterside vibes in the city this season.|restaurants
: Just above the waterside Chicago’s most iconic location for dining with a soaring view is undoubtedly The Signature Room|restaurants
Unless you’re paralyzed by a fear of heights, that is, because in order to get to the restaurant you’ll need to ascend an elevator to the 95th floor of the John Hancock|restaurants
Once here, you’ll savor modern American cuisine with a seasonal tilt, plus craft cocktails, wine and beer|restaurants
No matter where you’re seated, you’ll be rewarded with majestic, awe-inspiring views of Lake Michigan and the skyline|restaurants
The best seats in the house, though, are the ones perched up against the north-facing glass wall, which affords a stunning vista of Chicago’s beach-lined north side.|restaurants
: One of the most criminally underrated restaurants when it comes to sky-high dining in Chicago, Cite gets you so close to the lake you may actually feel like you could fall in|restaurants
Located on the 70th floor  of Lake Point Tower, the only skyscraper east of Lake Shore Drive, and just in front of Navy Pier, the soaring restaurant has extraordinary views from every angle|restaurants
The seafood, steaks, cocktails and tasting menus aren’t too shabby, either|restaurants
Using French techniques and a seasonal mentality, the restaurant features ever-changing dishes like lobster tail with butter gnocchi, sesame-crusted Alaskan salmon, venison strip loin with poached pear and rack of lamb with ratatouille.|restaurants
: When it comes to beachy dining in the city, it doesn’t get much better — or beachier — than Caffe Oliva|restaurants
This bright and sunny cafe is literally located right on Ohio Street Beach alongside Navy Pier, providing a warm, relaxing vibe to your patio dining experience|restaurants
This year’s menu is better than ever, featuring an eclectic lineup of shareable plates like Greek bruschetta, fried calamari with lime aioli, coconut shrimp, margherita flatbreads, blackened whitefish with tzatziki and a slew of sandwiches and burgers|restaurants
There’s also a kids’ menu, desserts, brunch and a ton of cocktails|restaurants
Keep the group party going with one of Caffe Oliva’s fish bowls, designed to satisfy a thirsty group with potions like the “Finding Nemo”: blueberry vodka, pineapple juice, sour, fresh lemon juice and Swedish fish.|restaurants
Pinstripes: If the idea of dining and drinking at a bowling alley sounds like a joke to you, then clearly you haven’t spent any time at a Pinstripes|restaurants
This beloved mini-chain is popular for good reason, and their Streeterville location (the only one in city limits) backs it all up with the added bonus of being right on the Ogden Slip harbor, with a lengthy fire pit-lined patio overlooking the lake|restaurants
In addition to bowling and bocce inside, Pinstripes sets itself apart as a restaurant destination in and of itself, with casual yet inventive Italian food that’s great both for snacking-while-gaming and for a leisurely meal al fresco or indoors.|restaurants
: For upscale Italian fare with an equally impressive vista, don’t miss Cafe Spiaggia|restaurants
Or really if you’re feeling decadent, it’s even more upscale sister restaurant Spiaggia|restaurants
But due to its more accessible offerings, Cafe Spiaggia is certainly an easier stopover for a quick lunch with a sensational overlooking the top of the Magnificent Mile and Oak Street Beach|restaurants
The restaurant offers a contemporary, elegant take on classic Italian cuisine, making for a fine meal while nestled along the windows above one of the most famous shopping streets in the country.|restaurants
|restaurants
The South Loop outpost of the boil-in-a-bag seafood concept, which specializes in Cajun-style shellfish, has added weekend brunch to its popular portfolio|restaurants
A slight departure from its usual eat-with-your-hands bag-centric menu, the brunch offerings span a spectrum of Southern comforts, from fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese to snow crab cake Benedict, biscuits and gravy, shrimp and grits and chicken and waffles|restaurants
Of course those seafood boils will still be available as an option, filled with customizable provisions like sausage, crab and shrimp|restaurants
Cheesy grits, honey butter cornbread and garlic beignets are available as sides|restaurants
For something sweet, opt for the deep-fried Oreos, and wash it all down with a mimosa, Bloody Mary or a quenching highball|restaurants
Brunch is served Saturdays and Sundays from noon until 3:00 p.m.|restaurants
has been a smash hit since it debuted last year, racking up the accolades and drawing hordes of diners for its glam dinner service|restaurants
Now, the glitzy Gold Coast bastion has added breakfast and brunch, providing even more opportunities to sample the decadence|restaurants
The weekday breakfast menu consists of various toasts (avocado, tahini-banana-honey and smoked salmon), plus pastries aplenty, wholesome bowls (yogurt with muesli and peaches or acai with raw coconut and goji berries) and specialties like asparagus and fontina omelettes, ham and hashbrown Benedict, black truffle scrambled eggs and shirred eggs Florentine|restaurants
Come weekend brunch, the breakfast lineup is adjoined by a series of lunch-y items, like Brussels sprouts leaves salad with mustard vinaigrette and Medjool dates, Yang’s Imperial lobster toast with caviar and beef Wellington with mushroom bordelaise.|restaurants

At the same time Meng got going with the rice, steamed overnight, then cooked out like a risotto in a supercharged vegetable stock/mix, resulting in something that was redolent of xi fan|restaurants
Finally it is topped with chopped mizuna for freshness.|restaurants
A spoonful of the rice… wow the fullness of flavour, a pure vegetable umami, warm, comforting, familiar, luscious, simultaneously a dish prepared with precision of technique|restaurants
Banging bowl of fish on rice|restaurants
This is what its all about – Pure Deliciousness!|restaurants
, specifically the bone marrow varuval + paratha is a kind of perfection – More than enough words for a restaurant already over-showered with praise.|restaurants

Mastery of modern and classic technique, perfectly executed with creative pairings that – for me – show a brave Chef carving out his corner of Tokyo|restaurants

  You’ve arrived at londoneater.com – where a foodlover living in London (me) writes about his favourite subject|restaurants
First of all, thank you for visiting, feel free…|restaurants
It’s now been over a year since Alex Dilling took over the reigns from Arnaud Bignon, and what year it has been for this this charming little restaurant that has survived the decades with its series of chefs|restaurants
Alex has been working non-stop upping the ante with each passing season, and most recently was rewarded by the bib in maintaining the two star rating of afforded to Abela’s crowning glory since Bignon first won it in 2013.|restaurants
I’ve visited Alex about 5 – 6 visits in this past year since he took over and with each successive meal, I’ve observed the supremely talented Chef seemingly outdo himself at each turn, knocking out astounding and exciting dishes of true technical excellence that in my view makes him a legitimate recipient of a future third star|restaurants
Alongside Claude Bosi and Brett Graham, IMHO, these are the three guys currently sitting at the very apex of London gastronomy|restaurants
That is, if the guide awarded their stars based purely on the performance of the kitchen in that snapshot in time.|restaurants
If you have something to celebrate, you should certainly consider The Greenhouse, including the n25 aged caviar supplement when presented with the choice|restaurants
Photos and a few comments from my latest meal there.|restaurants
Just when I think these guys have set the bar, they find another way to level up, never resting on their laurels|restaurants
The craft involved blows my mind|restaurants
This dish – an entree and not pudding – actually works best as a surprise…|restaurants
….but if you need to know, then it is in fact tartare of Scotch lango with caviar|restaurants
One of my favourite classic combos, often presented in various guises by others (Passard’s nouvelle classic is one of my all time favourites), but none quite like this.|restaurants
It is encased in a set creme crue that’s soft, and somewhat gravity defying in keeping its perfectly spherical shape|restaurants
Served with an ultra clean apple and bergamot consommé, its freshness and acidity counterbalancing the cream and shellfish|restaurants
No modernist trickery here, just good old fashioned high level craft.|restaurants
Alex did mention that they are still tweaking the ratios (less cream, more caviar core), but as it stands, I think it’s already absolutely top notch stuff|restaurants
Simplicity, product quality, refinement, precision.|restaurants
With an onsen quail egg, thinly shaved matsutake, 18mo mimolette, jamon Iberico, watercress puree, a deep roast chicken jus|restaurants
The noble mushroom (this particular specimen being Canadian) now entering its last days of the season, but losing none of its distinct and unmistakable spicy, pine flavour which more than stands up to the mature cheese.|restaurants
Oh yeah my kind of sandwich, I loved this so much, being reflective of Alex’s approach as the core of his cuisine is all about unadulterated satisfaction.|restaurants
Such an elegant dish that is squarely about product and precision of cooking|restaurants
The trinity of flavours entirely marine, juicy grilled turbot with golden caramelisation, a satin smooth sauce imbued with oyster minerality, and the rich rush of creamy brine from the caviar… refinement and simplicity – my kind of fish course, loved it.|restaurants
Noble fish + caviar is a winning combo when done right imho|restaurants
And the key is the ratio for it to fly, like at L’Ambrosie or P53 and indeed as is this dish right here.|restaurants
8|restaurants
Hunter style Landes chicken with ceps, glazed boneless stuffed chicken wing, daikon salad roll, pomme souffle, and Alba white truffle.|restaurants
I’m certain you’ve already seen piccies of this elsewhere, and it does indeed taste every bit as epic as it looks 🌟🌟🌟|restaurants
The outermost chicken and Alsace bacon farci is soft all the way to the incredible crust; the detailing and the finishing of which simply astonishing|restaurants
The corrugated grill lines, the shiny glaze, the thyme and shiso flower adornments, and the seamless albufera sauce|restaurants
For me, the best white truffle dish of the season so far.|restaurants
I just had my “big spend” meal this year at the Clove Club (We limit £200+ a head meals to one or two a year) and i umm’d and ahh’d between CC, Greenhouse and a few others|restaurants
Now i see that chicken and croque madame dish im still wondering what i should have done|restaurants
Clove Club was fantastic though.|restaurants
I finally made it here and can genuinely say that I totally believe all the fanfare bandied around Christophe Pele’s gem in the house of Haut Brion|restaurants
His cuisine is one of modernity, subtlety and clarity|restaurants
Decidedly French with flourishes of Asian influence in a non-intrusive way (quite unlike say Barbot’s love of citrus-charged flavours), his lightness of touch across the dishes is inspired stuff and I find it extremely appealing.|restaurants
During lunch there are three choices of carte blanche menus, starting at 90euroes for a short 3 courses and going all the up to 190euroes for the six course menu Le Clarence|restaurants
In the evening, there is the epic 8 course which can be had for 320euroes|restaurants
I went for the 6 courses plus the white truffle supplement (60euroes), and arranged a little wine flight comprised of Haut Brion’s 2nd wines and their non first growth labels.|restaurants
Every course here is delivered as sequential multi-plates a la Gagnaire, and as a surprise|restaurants
In some regard, the spontaneity of Pele’s creative cuisine feels much like a grand version of Parisian bistronomy, played out in a most opulent setting|restaurants
I think it is every bit worthy of its two star rating and I would compare Pele’s idea of a carte blanche to that of Passage 53|restaurants
Both Chefs’ frame their menus around a string of balanced and light dishes that flow from the start to finish.|restaurants
What really makes Le Clarence rather unique of course are that you can opt for the HM and LMHB first wines – both the whites and the reds – by the glass, and indeed fashion a wine flight based around them|restaurants
They would still cost a ton, at 130 – 200 euroes a glass, but not thousands if you were to pop the cork on 4 bottles of each of the white and red Graves.|restaurants
Is it a candidate for 3 stars today? Probably not, as I feel that Pele is still tweaking his ideas about Cantonese flavours in his cuisine|restaurants
Also, a couple of docked points for presenting tourists with a sub-standard white truffle that is at the moment (mid Nov 2019) showing very well near its peak season|restaurants
However as it stands, his cuisine is very attractive, the cuisson is generally spot-on and I would love to revisit to see how he is progressing in due time.|restaurants
A light and fresh start, and all about textures, crunch of the filo, the dense fleshiness of the langoustine, and the softened bite of the pigs ears, tied together with a light chilli sauce that’s punches more with acidity than spice.|restaurants
Classic earth & sea combo, but the modern and light prep was to me a joy to eat|restaurants
The scallop is mi-cuit, and the kiss of the plancha infusing it with an all encompassing smokiness, lifted by the lactic creaminess of the buffalo milk.|restaurants
If the first way was lightness, this was to emphasise the scallop’s richer profile|restaurants
The flavour combinations here harmonious and complex, earthy sweetness, with the nutty, buttery richness of the tonato sauce, but carefully judged to not overwhelming the delicacy of the scallop’s natural sweetness.|restaurants
The first was seabass roasted skin side down|restaurants
Flourished with capucine flower, anchovy, tarvido radicchio that’s been gently rolled on the plancha, softening its mild bitterness , and an exceptional squid ink sauce that has lovely sweet-vinegar gastrique contrasting with the bitter-sweet of the endive and the fish’s umami|restaurants
A dish that seems so simple, but with everything so measured and so carefully cooked, it was dancing on the palate.|restaurants
The second, steamed shrimp bao on pumpkin purée; poached oyster with Jerusalem artichoke, beef broth and lemon|restaurants
While the seabass was superb, I actually enjoyed the second serving more|restaurants
The bao was very good indeed, the richness of shellfish melding especially well with the buttery, sweet and seamlessly smooth pumpkin purée – a successful marriage of French and Chinese flavours|restaurants
This was followed by a warm finish of classic beef and oysters.|restaurants
First was lacquered with soy sauce and the cuisson on this was phenomenal, wobbly and the perfect shade of light pink in the centre|restaurants
with beurre blanc and daurenki wrapped in spinach and lightly toasted on the pan|restaurants
Joyfully elegant and precise cooking.|restaurants
The second was battered and deep fried, KFC sweetbreads on top of a very airy, whipped sabayon that was subtly sweet, I’m guessing with a little Madeira drizzled in.|restaurants
The mains in three plates, with Alba truffle, paired with a glass of HB’s 2nd wine, the Le Clarence from 07|restaurants
Clockwise from the centre:|restaurants
Slick cooking on the quail, accompanied by rich flavours both with the parm drizzled ravioli, and the squid ink sauce, which I believe is made with some of the gizzards folded in, giving rise to a meatier sauce, as compared to the much lighter version that came with the seabass.|restaurants
Although, my favourite component was the eel -which IMHO easily rivals good Kansai style unagi- and the pairing with lightly cooked foie gras melting into the sweet savoury glaze was absolutely delicious.|restaurants
The only downer perhaps was the white truffle itself|restaurants
Not the best example, a little dry with its aromatic powers waning, and unable to keep pace with the array of flavour across the plates.|restaurants
Cigar of lemon cream, homemade (and extremely light) waffles with a beautiful chestnut syrup (like liquid marron glace) and stiff vanilla chantilly.|restaurants
…I really didn’t expect to be, but came away very impressed by this brunch|restaurants

I have it on good account that this is not a mere carbon copy of the great Chef’s Parisian offshoot, also called Dame de Pic near the Louvre, rather it is the more ambitious of the twins|restaurants
The great chef is of course Anne-Sophie Pic, she inherits a gastronomic dynasty so to speak with a long standing association with the bib, that stretches all the way to when they first revised (and introduced) their multi star rating system.|restaurants
Thought not her originally chosen path, she follows in the footsteps of her grandfather Andre, her father Jacques and eventually took over the kitchen from her brother Alain in 1998|restaurants
She received the coveted 3 stars in her own right in 2007|restaurants
She also owns another eponymous restaurant in Lausanne which currently holds 2 stars|restaurants
No small feat considering there are not many female chefs in pro kitchens, let alone ones who have reached the pinnacle of their profession|restaurants
We do have Clare Smyth over here, who will hopefully open her own doors, in the Summer|restaurants
Much in the spirit of the great Eugenie Brazier and Marie Bourgeois.|restaurants
And that will be enough wiki sleuthing, as we look to the present and the future with this latest venture, Pic’s first in Blighty in the brand new and very impressive Four Seasons at Trinity Square in Tower Hill.|restaurants
This is my first visit to a Pic restaurant, she does have many well-known dishes floating around the web that identifies her style as her own, with the incorporation of ingredients where you may, lets say, not expect them in a classic sense|restaurants
Not to mention her striking puddings, and I think particularly of the chocolate lattice and also the all-white millefeuille.|restaurants
Some of her top-end stuff (including the MF) as well as her family classics makes appearances at Dame London, and for this, she has entrusted it to an Italian, Luca Piscazzi|restaurants
He has La Pergola (Rome’s only 3 star), Amber HK and Apsleys, the previous occupant restaurant at Lanesborough before Eric Frechon moved in, on his resume.|restaurants
The wine list is… expensive|restaurants
I note that they do Latour BTG, on this visit, 2004 at £185 for 125ml|restaurants
This translates to a bottle price of £1110, which would be at least the 3x mark-up (to be optimistic)|restaurants
Bottom line is one thing, but value for money (compared to market price) is another, but I think this is a little too much for a relatively young Latour and especially considering the private club in the hotel is organised around the first growth, I expect more of a deal|restaurants
For that money, at least a 2000 perhaps|restaurants
The wine list (and the Latour discovery room) is looked after by somm Jan Konetzki, who has joined from Gordon Ramsay RHR.|restaurants
Meanwhile in the restaurant – in keeping with London – they have laid out a brasserie-like room that walks the tight rope of being gastronomic business and gastronomic casual|restaurants
Brown leather banquettes, towering pillars of stained glass and triple height ceilings.|restaurants
We visit for friday lunch, and ordered a 3 course meal|restaurants
My brother ate from the lunch concessions (£39 for three) and I ate from the ALC.|restaurants
A siphoned cauliflower puree midly spiced with ginger and generously topped with shavings of mimolette cheese and esplette pepper|restaurants
A simple but very delicious umami concoction.|restaurants
Grilled to golden brown crust and soft centre|restaurants
Classically paired with a hollandaise, albeit mildly infused with curry|restaurants
Yes|restaurants
Lovely work really and a good shout to stick these spears for the lunch set menu|restaurants
The white asparagus from the south of France now starting to come into peak season, that is to say quality and also a dive in prices.|restaurants
I asked our waitress to bring out a live one and was rather impressed that they did|restaurants
A beauty and such a precious thing|restaurants
Pretty big, looks about 150g, so I will say 4 head.|restaurants
Meuniere I think, and to a rare centre|restaurants
It’s very tender, retaining all of its natural briny sweetness|restaurants
The citrus provides freshness, and the deep (deep) dashi gives seasoning|restaurants
A hearty style for abalone, almost “rustic”, especially with the smoked potato puree hiding in the sauce, but the handiwork is excellent|restaurants
Generous portions, looks like a whole one in here|restaurants
I’m over the moon.|restaurants
‘s purer style is awesome, but of course, Pic’s preparation is equally a quality treatment for the noble product|restaurants
For those who bang on about quality produce, this is one such specimen|restaurants
In fact outside of Hedone and Bonhams, I don’t know if any other London restaurant offers Live abalone|restaurants
I hope you guys eat more of it, so more chefs over here will offer it|restaurants
They’re not as glamorous as Ise or Australian, but Irish and Breton abalones are pretty decent, in the right hands.|restaurants
Thighs on the lunch concessions set|restaurants
Works for me, the best cuts on the bird|restaurants
Presumably, the breasts go on the ALC plates and so it means the set lunch is both cheaper and the better choice! Beautifully roasted by the way, succulent and juicy.|restaurants
Perfectly cooked sole from Brixham, with a superb sauce|restaurants
Freshness of green apple rises to your olfactory (not unlike when you peel one) and ends with a subtle spectre of anise in the finish.|restaurants
I really like the sauce, it lifts the dish rather than interfere with the inherent quality of the fish|restaurants
Nothing clogging up the palate here, clean and clear cooking|restaurants
Solid * territory.|restaurants
Given the price tag, I would have liked Wye, Pertuis or perhaps even Roque-Hautes, used at her other restaurants|restaurants
These Kent ones were tasty nevertheless.|restaurants
Of course the reference point is Alain Ducasse, specifically Monaco, thought I have never had it before, so I won’t be able to add my value to it.|restaurants
For what it is worth, I thought the sponge was merely ordinary|restaurants
I like the seasonal addition of the gariguettes, as I have written recently in my last entry, they are beautiful and this very time of the year|restaurants
Superior fragrant, so much so, I think it almost a waste to manipulate them, as they are best eaten as they are.|restaurants
An atypical MF and very striking in its construction|restaurants
The ultimate homage to vanilla|restaurants
If not mistaken, it is not a creme pat enveloping the exterior, rather it is a whipped vanilla cream (with yoghurt), topped with meringue based icing|restaurants
Inside the puff, is a jasmine jelly, served ice cold, it is more like a sorbet layer|restaurants
In its entirety, there are textural, flavour and temperature gradients throughout|restaurants
The milk foam is subtly infused with pepper, emphasis on the subtle, and works well as a ‘finish’ on the palate|restaurants
A little interesting that this pepper (Voatsiperifery) is from Madagascar, and yet Pic has elected not to use Bourbon vanilla|restaurants
I would have thought that ingredients from the same terroir would have more affinity for one another, but well, maybe not, who knows.|restaurants
that it looks!) idea to change up the classic pudding with the cream plastered around the pastry|restaurants
And in London too|restaurants
I won’t list the top-tier MFs we now have in London|restaurants
Some are tall and traditional; others lay flat and impossibly light, with ice creams that do not ‘melt’|restaurants
You know where they are.|restaurants
The bill came to £162.32 for 2 people for all food, 1 beer, 1 glass of Alsatian Pinot Blanc, a bottle of water and service|restaurants
The set lunch half of the bill was around £50, and an ALC meal came in at £110.|restaurants
The cooking is very good here, easily in the 1 star bracket IMHO|restaurants
If this is truly a reflection of Pic’s palate, then I would say the Chef has a great one|restaurants
The cuisine is of course very French, but it is her use of subtle non-traditional flavour pairings that really brighten the recipes|restaurants
I like that the cuisine is quite compact, allowing main ingredients to taste naturally as they should|restaurants
There is nothing over the top here and nothing is out of control – which is testament to Luca’s management of the team.|restaurants
Their sourcing is good, especially for fish, featuring the best of the West Country, Scotland and plugging the holes in British terrior, with French produce|restaurants
I would liken this to Les 110 somewhat in ‘conception’ and in terms of the relaxed ambiance|restaurants
Though the reality is that DdPL is a more ambitious outfit (it is the Four Seasons after all), and this is obviously reflected in the difference in bottom line|restaurants
Over time, I am keen to see the menu change up and to see more of Pic’s signature dishes pop-up here|restaurants
It is nearly the summer, might we see soft-shell native Cornish lobsters in Pic’s red fruit dashi perhaps? It would fit in quite well with what DdPL is about, I think.|restaurants
The full prices may make you wince, but I must say that they have put quite some effort into their lunch menus and provide ample value for money, considering what’s on the plate|restaurants
The weekday 3 courses for £39 is superb, but the next time I return, I will be looking closely at the Weekend 4 course lunch for £55|restaurants
Both the sole and millefeuille are on the weekend lunch set|restaurants
Well worth a visit.|restaurants
I love the research and detail you put into this post as well as your others, this personally isn’t my type of cuisine but still very much enjoyed reading it and may visit on a special occasion 🙂|restaurants
Agree with Christian|restaurants
Through your blog, I can see the amount of time and energy put in to making this post that’s very insightful for people who are interested about this restaurant or generally the places to visit in London.|restaurants
Just booked in for the end of the month , I`ll be happy if it looks and tastes like your meal|restaurants
I`ll most probably go for the tasting menu so I can get a taste of what Pic`s cuisine is all about.|restaurants
Hello folks, I am officially back from my month long vacation, trust you have applied yourselves positively while I’ve been away|restaurants
My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year|restaurants
I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff|restaurants
Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold|restaurants
Bling|restaurants
I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent|restaurants
I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money|restaurants
I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine|restaurants
It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours|restaurants
Something as common as say pizza for example – I can’t say I’ve actually tried a Neapolitan recipe passed down from the ages|restaurants
This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against|restaurants
And so Kang’s quest to catch a glimpse into the world of Taiwanese cuisine was born|restaurants
Here are his notes (So weird writing in the third person).|restaurants
The scene is Taipei|restaurants
The capital of the island republic, it is situated on the Northern tip of the country and its name unsurprisingly translates to ‘Northern Taiwan’|restaurants
Home to 2.6 million, it is an emerging ultra modern metropolis of Blade Runner style concrete jungle and it’s skyline proudly accomodates Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world|restaurants
Like all cities, there are shades of vintage buildings still lingering underneath all the shiny metal and glass|restaurants
Old shop houses prop up the neon signs, lighting up the city’s night like a Christmas tree|restaurants
It’s wonderfully urban, tight street corners just wide enough for cars to pass through and temperamental rainclouds which make London feel like Cyprus|restaurants
In the belly of the beast lies a diverse range of restaurant, cafés and their famed night markets which play host to hundreds of independent street food vendors making it a sort of foodie’s wet dream|restaurants
In fact, there is so much diversity in it’s food, a week is simply not enough time to try everything|restaurants
But I tried anyway|restaurants
My excursion wouldn’t be as impactful if not for my extended family taking me around the city, so I have the C and C’s to thank for all the recs.|restaurants
With Londoners experiencing a spike in Sichuan food, I thought it’d be appropriate that our first stop was Chuan Ba Zhe – a Szechuan restaurant that does all-you-can-eat ‘Ma-la’ hotpots for about 8 per head.|restaurants
The local flavour – Gold Medal Beer|restaurants
The brew is light and carries a chrysanthemum sweetness about it – very easy drinking stuff|restaurants
We started with a selection of ‘small dishes’ to share dishes and to start – something which is characteristic of a Taiwanese meal – including Kousiu (Saliva) chicken , Quaiwei (weird taste) vermicelli, Dou gan zhe (bean curd slices) and Mala tripe|restaurants
As it was a Szechuan restaurant, everything was red in colour, evident of potent sliced chilli everywhere and the tranquilising effect of Szechuan pepper slowly started to grab hold of my tastebuds|restaurants
Terrifying.|restaurants
The main highlight of the meal was the all-you-can-eat hotpot, the freeloading aspect in that we could order as much meat or vegetables we wanted to chuck into the soup.|restaurants
Now, this is properly spicy stuff|restaurants
The soup was made with szechuan pepper and as I alluded to earlier, doesn’t just burn your tongue and throat, it actually conjures up a strange numbing sensation that firstly starts on the back of your tongue, and if you’re greedy, works it’s way into the back of your throat|restaurants
I downed several glasses of gold medal beer to put the fire out|restaurants
Eventually, I couldn’t feel my tastebuds anymore|restaurants
If you head to Angelis in Kilburn or|restaurants
in Earls Court, you’ll be able get your hands on a Ma-la hotpot|restaurants
It’s usually protocol to have a layer of oil floating on top of the soup, it’s suppose to keep the heat in and also to cook whatever you’ve dunked into the soup|restaurants
I am certain that London restaurants hold back on the peppers – this place didn’t.|restaurants
We rode the MRT – Taipei’s equivalent of the tube – to Danshui and to the very end of the line|restaurants
The town is a scenic getaway from the high tech city of Taipei|restaurants
Here, people rolled around in vespas and flip flops and beyond the bridges, you can watch fishermen barbecueing their triumphs by the beach|restaurants
Restaurants lined the coast, and as we went on a Sunday, it was as if all of Taipei had descended upon this area|restaurants
We had trekked all the way here to visit the Black Shop, and to sample the locally celebrated pork chop rice.|restaurants
A large bowl of their signature pork chop costs two pounds, less if our political system was in better working order|restaurants
Like all umami infused food – this bowl of rice smelled hearty, rustic and fragrant|restaurants
Served piping hot, the large flap of chop garnished with bean braised tofu and pickled cabbage that carried a vinegary stink|restaurants
The rice was glutinous, almost sushi rice (but I daren’t claim it) and the savoury flouriness of the pork chop was unmistakable|restaurants
There was a thin outer which encapsulated the piece of meat, eggs must have been used and the coating absorbed alot of moisture leading to a juiciness which softened the texture of the pork|restaurants
The combination of the bean-flavoured tofu, the vinegary pickled cabbage and the soya infused egginess of the porkchop gave way to an exemplary example of umami… I finished two bowls.|restaurants
The black shop was still entertaining massive queues at 3pm in the afternoon, and this was a huge restaurant spread over two floors – such was the popularity of it’s pork chop rice|restaurants
While there, it was also an opportunity to give one of Taiwan’s best – if common – small dishes a try : Cold creamy tofu with sweet century egg.|restaurants
When I say creamy, I mean really creamy|restaurants
The texture is so consistent, it hardly broke and is akin to the density of say a pannacota|restaurants
Flavoured with a sweetened soya sauce, the purity of the tofu melds well with the mushy liverness of the preserved duck eggs|restaurants
The strength of this dish – in my opinion – is dependent on the quality of the tofu|restaurants
The real deal, everything in London is a mere imitation.|restaurants
We headed out bright and early the next day so that I could run a few errands while in Taipei|restaurants
Things are generally cheaper, I had my Seiko Kinetic fixed for just under £40 compared to a whopping £85 minimum if I sent it to Maidenhead|restaurants
I also had bought a pair of thick black rimmed glasses – Clark Kent style – for a reasonable price…|restaurants
yes, as if Gary Rhodes would suddenly recognised me attempting to ‘review’ his restaurant, says my ego.|restaurants
We went to Jiang Jia, not particular special, nor exciting but it was something distinctly local and also open 24 hours a day.|restaurants
A bowl of salty soya milk made with pickled lettuce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, maldive fish and a tiny splash of soya sauce – definitely a change from the rock sugar syrup of HK style sweet tofufa|restaurants
My favourite were the glutinous rice roll stuffed with pork floss and pickled radish|restaurants
I thought it was interesting to have a dough explosion of sorts with a youtiaw – fried dough – stuffed with a chinese style omelette on a sesame crusted bread roll – called a ‘shao bing you tiew jia dan’ or otherwise a chinese breakfast butty perhaps.|restaurants
I spent alot of time getting lost in the side streets which hid makeshift markets and the occasional street food vendor, photographing this street life proved to be one of the highlights of my visit to Taipei.|restaurants
All I could see was the romance of the older parts of Taipei, so rustic, raw and human, it was here that I felt the life and the buzz of the real city.|restaurants
We have now just got off Dingxi station and my other half and decided to take me to one of her old favourite noodle shops|restaurants
Small, unassuming and humble|restaurants
There would be nothing high brow about it, but again the attraction was apparent in it’s unpretension, just so real.|restaurants
And here, I had tasted one of the best spare rib & taro soups to date|restaurants
The soup was oily, but filled with meaty and stocky flavours – very homely|restaurants
Like most of the soupy meats I had sampled in Taipei, the spare ribs melted like ice cream.|restaurants
Finally, our last destination led us to the Golden Formosa, famous for none other than authentic Taiwanese cuisine, and I was assured that it doesnt get more authentic, or local than this.|restaurants
There are several variations of the ‘White-Cut’ Chicken in the different types of Chinese cuisine, and it so happens to be a local favourite in Taiwan, which claims a variation of their own|restaurants
It’s a mainstay in Cantonese cooking and is a sort of a national symbol of Singapore cuisine in which it is referred to as Hainanese Chicken|restaurants
The skin is salty and oily, but the meat is juice heaven and silky smooth|restaurants
There is rich chicken flavour and a clinical taste on the palate|restaurants
The chicken bounces with every bite and is just a joy to eat – getting breast meat to soften up is a family secret, and the breast meat at Golden formosa was much like caressing the equivalent assets of a beautifully woman, or…|restaurants
What is aromatic to a Taiwanese person just reeked to my untrained palate|restaurants
This dish stank of bamboo shoots and vinegar, the tripe added to the soured livery flavours of this dish|restaurants
It was a difficult mouthful for me, not my cup of tea this one, but about as Taiwanese as it could get.|restaurants
I think the thick gravy – slimy and very fishy – was probably made from the juices scallop and the oyster|restaurants
It was like a runny pizza with a dough that absorbed too much moisture|restaurants
Very potent, I could only have a slice before the fishiness became overwhelming.|restaurants
This one I really enjoyed – one of the most memorable dishes from my trip|restaurants
Crunchy popcorn like exterior, bubbly crispiness and a peppery hit with a worschester sauce tang|restaurants
I am certain that there was curry powder in the mixture and which which really gave ribs a spice of life|restaurants
The meat still juicy on the inside but the distinct sour and spicy crackle on the outside.|restaurants
So that was my trip to Taipei|restaurants
The most memorable meal has got to be the Pork Chop rice – simple food, but oh so good|restaurants
In addition to this, I wrote up on one of Taiwan’s greatest treasure –|restaurants
at three of Taipei’s most respected Beef noodle houses|restaurants
Alright, well a belated happy new year of the Tiger folks, hope you enjoyed my adventures away from home|restaurants
I think it’s about time I got back to writing up about London again|restaurants
See you monday.|restaurants
I have fond memories of eating pork chop rice in those ben dung that are served on trains in Taiwan|restaurants
 Did you try any zen bing on your trip?  [My pinyin is haphazard – zen bing are those ‘chinese burritos’ that you can get at street markets in Taipei.]|restaurants
Very interesting blog post – Taiwanese food is not something you hear a lot about|restaurants
Makes me want to explore tofu a whole lot more though, particularly as a seasoning.|restaurants
Your thoughts on the extreme fishy/vinegary flavours were probably about right too – I reckon people from outside Europe/US might feel the same about Stinking Bishop, Stilton, Vacherin etc.|restaurants
Can I ask where you went for the spare ribs and taro soup? The wife is very keen on trying that|restaurants
Anything else worth eating in that shop?|restaurants
Wild Boar – The place is called Da Jia Hao (or everybody good in chinese!)|restaurants
You come out of the MRT station Dingxi (MRT Orange Line) , I think it’s exit number 1, up the escalator, its on the left hand side and you will see the place ‘through the window’ as you are going up the escalator…|restaurants
more confusing that it sounds, but trust me it should make more sense when you guys get there, basically it’s in a separate building just outside the station 🙂 Ahh… when you are in DingXi make sure try THE original soya milk shop called ‘Dou Jiang Da Wang’|restaurants
The directions… are difficult to describe, but it’s a five minute walk from the station (Dingxi) and any local in the area should know this place, very popular… ok good luck and hope you enjoy it!!!|restaurants
Am in Singapore right now and was just feasting on ‘Hainanese Chicken’ rice for lunch a moment ago|restaurants
I have always thought that the dish originated from the Malayan Straits but perhaps I am mistaken|restaurants
I mean, it’s essentially poached chicken isn’t it? In fact, I first heard of White Cut Chicken (or ‘bai qie ji’) when a Hongkong colleague mentioned it to me in London|restaurants
lol.|restaurants
Great write up! I am taking my first trip to Taiwan in a few weeks time, so your post will make great reference material!|restaurants
An American in London – Taipei is a great place for food, so much to eat! Zen bing? Is the bread white, soft and fluffy? Nope, don’t think I tried it on this trip!|restaurants
London Chow – Yeah, essentially the same recipe of poached chicken|restaurants
I did a bit of research and I think that there are several variations of this recipe, with each cuisine claiming a version of it, and I think there are a few twists and touches with each version|restaurants
I know for a fact that Bai Zhan Chicken is part and parcel of Hainan cuisine… because my grandfather is from Hainan and he passed down a family recipe to my aunts and uncles (my grandfather is a chef, my dad doesnt cook)|restaurants
In Taiwan, I believe the recipe came from parts of southern China, probably in a similar fashion as Niu Rou Mien.|restaurants
Oh not fluffy, etc|restaurants
 Zen bing really is like a burrito|restaurants
 You get a flour pancake (almost like a flour tortilla, but a bit tougher – hot off the griddle), and it’s filled with a little rice, veg, egg, chinese sausage – whatever you like, really|restaurants
 The best part, in my opinion, was always the crushed peanuts/peanut powder to add crunch and sweet nuttiness|restaurants
 It’s great stuff and I’d recommend looking out for it next time you’re in Tapiei|restaurants
 [I used to spend summers in Taipei when I was little.]|restaurants
i think AAIL is referring to ‘jian bing’|restaurants
the panfried chinese dough ‘biscuits’ with some sort of savoury filling? variations like hu jiao bing (pepper biscuit) or da bing bao xiao bing (big biscuit wrapping small biscuit).|restaurants
http://blog.istarvin.com/2010/03/08/weekly-round-up-of-the-national-critics%E2%80%99-restaurant-reviews-by-oliverthring-803/|restaurants
Looks like you had a good time and ate plenty|restaurants
 Great write up and mouth watering pics as always, makes me want to get into photography… I actually have an SLR but never found the time to play with it! =)|restaurants
great post and awesome pictures… i think what AAIL is talking about is “run bing”.|restaurants
it’s a thin crepe/tortilla like wrapper that encompasses stirfried cabbage and other veggies, ground peanuts and cilantro.|restaurants
they also make a dessert version i’ve discovered with ice cream and ground peanuts (and cilantro!)|restaurants
Sonoma Grill, Taipei : Well travelled American beef|restaurants
« London Eater – London food blog and restaurant reviews and restaurant guide|restaurants
This is such a great post, Taiwanese food is always so flavoursome and seasoned! I wonder if you ever found hujiao bing in London, can you let me know?|restaurants
The 2019 prices have risen nearly across the board, though quality remains ever so high here at L’Arpege|restaurants
Spontaneity and creativity reign supreme, Passard and his kitchen still immensely spirited in their practice of gastronomy at the highest levels, they continue to introduce new dishes to their menu, not bad for a restaurant now in its 33rd year|restaurants
As usual, Tony Beldroega was in charge of the affairs today, with the Chef himself making an appearance mid-way through lunch to greet punters|restaurants
I had wanted to try Alain’s latest Frankenstein creation, the Chimera, pigeon stiched together with a rack of lamb, but alas it wasn’t on the menu on this visit.|restaurants
For this meal, I decided to try the Gardener’s lunch again, now 175€ ,  supplemented with a half portion of the lobster/vin jaune (now 210€ for the whole, 105€ for the half) and also asked kindly if I could try their vegetable tatin as well as their strawberries, now in its prime.|restaurants
As you might be familiar, the lunch menu is essentially themed around whatever vegetables they have in abundance from Alain’s two gardens|restaurants
They tend to repeat themselves over the course of the longish meal|restaurants
In the case of this meal, yellow round courgettes and white asparagus appeared to be at peak|restaurants
If you arrive at the restaurant around 11ish, you’ll see the little white van delivering their daily haul of greens.|restaurants
I feel that April/May is the best time to visit L’Arpege, especially if you are interested in vegetables|restaurants
All the colours are in full bloom, lobster and turbot are near their peaks, peas are sweet and strawberries are ripe and ready|restaurants
Cigalines instead of mara de bois or gariguttes this year.|restaurants
L’Arpege is a restaurant that continues to enthrall me, the cuisine is very much based on improvisation and it is very rustic and homely in many ways, the antithesis of rehearsed, static crafted tasting menus|restaurants
The food here is fine in its eating, while the dishes are beautiful to look at, the kitchen spends the majority cooking rather than plating little things perfectly|restaurants
Some people do not like it for this very reason, but I love L’Arpege because at the heart of it all, the restaurant is about pure cooking, slow grilled proteins cooked grand and whole, and daring la minute preparations for everything else|restaurants
It might seem counter intuitive to say this, but in today’s world of foraged, water bath modernism, L’Arpege is in the minority when it comes to actually delivering hot food on piping hot plates|restaurants
A pre-requisite as it always should be for any fine food that is cooked with love and respect!|restaurants
When you visit, it really is worth spending some time to study all their menus deeply, and then to make sure you speak up and ask for anything you want to try|restaurants
They can mix and match anything on their menus, and also stuff that’s not on their menus|restaurants
I cannot stress this enough, if you simply leave it up to them, chances are you will almost definitely be disappointed and wonder what the fuss is all about|restaurants
These guys love a challenge believe me, the more bespoke your menu is, the better the meal becomes|restaurants
It’s going to  cost an arm and leg regardless of what you do, so if you’ve made up your mind to go here, then do like Magnus Nilsson when he left L’Astrance and do it in style.|restaurants
I drank a most interesting wine, 2017 Les Vignes de Paradis Terroir du Léman Un Matin Face au Lac, which is made from 100% Chasselas, a grape that I don’t believe I’ve ever come across|restaurants
I wrote down chalky mango and peach on the nose, more of that on the palate, with oiliness to it|restaurants
Superb wine.|restaurants
Today with a consomme of asparagus, mint and thyme|restaurants
One of Alain’s classics, and one of my all time favourites from his oeuvre of vegetable cooking.|restaurants
All raw, beautifully composed, delicate and glassy textures|restaurants
It is very lightly seasoned, it doesn’t even have much in way of oil, a very sensitive and pure dish showcasing the natural flavour in which the Grand Cru vegetables from Alain’s gardens possess|restaurants
This is what I love about L’Arpege.|restaurants
I greatly enjoyed this meaty pate, loosely packed with the savouriness of duck fat and perfectly seasoned|restaurants
The peas were absolutely top notch, popping with brilliant sweetness|restaurants
I could eat a bowl of them! Printemps in overdrive.|restaurants
11|restaurants
Yellow round courgette with its flower stuffed with vegetables|restaurants
With a dollop of parsley puree and an emulsion of cauliflower and verbena|restaurants
Passard’s grand cru vegetables from his gardens meeting his kitchen’s three starred calibre craft|restaurants
This was incredible – roasted and fully imbued with smokey, charred flavours, the courgette itself of prime quality|restaurants
Meanwhile the flower was stuffed with a medley of superior savouriness, cooked down vegetables, onions, garlic, other things which my limited palate could hardly identify|restaurants
The sauce had deep flavour itself, backed up by luxurious and low density frothed creaminess and acidity, acting as a counterpoint to the roasted courgette.|restaurants
The layering of flavours fan out to cover all four tastes simultaneously leading to a wide gamut umami that had me scratching my head as to how they manage so much flavour extraction from purely just vegetables|restaurants
Genius dish, with its composition guided by the saturation of nature’s primary colours|restaurants
Exactly the sort of dish that only L’Arpege is capable of producing.|restaurants
I don’t have much love for this dish, as in the past I find the sweet and sour honey sauce both overly sweet and too acidic at the very same time|restaurants
On this occasion however, the sauce is reigned in, the sweet and acid gentle as opposed to a punch in the face|restaurants
Now I could taste the dance of sweetness between the ocean of the lobster and the earth of the translucent globe turnip slices|restaurants
The lobster this time round was cooked a pointe – just a touch mi-cuit|restaurants
This is a lovely dish when they get it right for sure.|restaurants
Decidedly simple, homely in appearance, adorned with chive flowers, though as we are at L’Arpege, the craft involved is a world class marvel|restaurants
It came piping hot, and no doubt cooked la minute as the pastry was still warm on arrival.|restaurants
As you must already be aware from the in-trend BBQ hispis that grace many restaurants today, this caramalised cabbage too transformed its raw, crunchy sweetness into something significantly more complex – meaty, smoky, fully softened yet remaining juicy at the very same time, suped up savouriness.|restaurants
The smoked eel puree was very concentrated, a swipe of it on the cabbage, buttered and well seasoned, and the flavours begin to harmonise – then the a-ha moment arrives – to the point when it feels like things are about to explode on the palate|restaurants
An inspired pairing, so simple, so perfectly seasoned and so utterly delicious.|restaurants
Of course the secret here is their supremely fine puff pastry, so delicate in its flakiness, that it gifts the tatin a soft and smooth texture, collapsing like a hot knife through butter with the gentlest push|restaurants
An embodiment of the genius comfort food and the exquisite craft of L’Arpege.|restaurants
Today with Spring cabbage, new potato and yellow round courgette|restaurants
Quartered lengthwise, each “aiguillette” position plated facing opposite directions with tail, tomalley and claw on the plate|restaurants
This dish is always served on a heavy plate that is piping hot, including the sauce taken to the highest temperature, frothed up to a lightened texture.|restaurants
It remains for me, the greatest preparation of Lobster I’ve ever tasted|restaurants
The vin jaune sauce, like all sauces at L’Arpège, is simply the finest|restaurants
The gastrique is perfect, the salt and acidity, the oxidative nuttiness of the wine, all these elements pulling and pushing to create harmony and tension with the lobster flesh and tomalley|restaurants
Put simply, I have not tasted a better sauce than this|restaurants
Today Tony has blended in some coral, yielding a light orange pigment, and adding layer of ocean sweetness to the sauce.|restaurants
The Chausey island lobster – tied rostrum to tail to keep the tail straight during its boil– is usually timed to mi-cuit, however on this visit, the tail was quite firm (firmer than the lobster/turnip served a few courses earlier), and to my taste a touch over, by a minute perhaps|restaurants
This was a pretty big lobster, looks 1kg mark|restaurants
It’s massive claw and knuckle on the other hand came out just right|restaurants
Saying this, the bounce on the meat was a sign of a healthy crustacean and didn’t detract from the overall experience|restaurants
I feel very fortunate to have had this a few times, I am perpetually in awe of it|restaurants
A dish of timeless magnificence.|restaurants
A decadent sugar rush that is incredibly light at the same time – such fine pastry work|restaurants
It evoked childhood memories of cream and honey, sugary sweets and honeyed ice cream|restaurants
I loved it.|restaurants
For me, this remains the gold standard of puff pastry|restaurants
Incredible fine and delicate flakes|restaurants
The chocolate is very pure, you can taste the bitterness and it comes without too much sweetness|restaurants
Personally, I prefer the vanilla MF over this one, but the all-chocolate puff pastry is definitely something to admire|restaurants
Class.|restaurants
Gariguttes have become synonymous with the European Spring and typically shows up on the menus here, so with a different DNA, I thought to give this a go|restaurants
These aren’t as fragrant as the gariguettes, rather balanced in flavour but quite juicy|restaurants
I wouldn’t say they are better than Mare des Bois either.|restaurants
It is pretty much as it says on the tin – strawberries in a honey sweet sauce that is followed closely by a jolt of acidity, finally the oils coating the palate.|restaurants
Beautiful review and writing … I just found out earlier this year that the classic lobster dish at L’Arpege happened to be “seasonal”|restaurants
I thought blue lobster from ‘Brittany’ area is available all year long (e.g|restaurants
you always find a lobster dish at L’Ambroisie)|restaurants
They are technically not seasonal and are indeed avaiable all year round|restaurants
But Lobsters in the English Channel between Dorset and Brittany are at their best around the summer, starting from say June and run till August|restaurants
July is probably the most plentiful month, and prices are cheapest|restaurants
I did have the lobster vin jaune in November last year.|restaurants
with a series of images that were taken completely inside the various restaurants that I had visited throughout 2009 and 2010|restaurants
You might even recognise some dishes in these photographs.|restaurants
entirely in portrait orientation, and all are based on the 8×10 frame, as opposed to the 8x11ish full-frame that the 35mm format offers|restaurants
I’ve done so because I feel that the 8×10 frame emphasises food very well, it’s shorter and a more logical frame to me… plus it fits an A4 page very well.|restaurants
I also keep a number of photography related articles on my portfolio site – like using a Leica M9 to shoot food for instance – so please feel free to pay a visit to|restaurants
if you like my food photography (or just like staring at food photos in general) and please keep me in mind if you have a photography job to carry out|restaurants
Especially if you are a restaurant.|restaurants
Kang Kang Kang|restaurants
The way you reel off all these amazing food pictures makes it seem like its so easy to you|restaurants
8 x 10 is a nice format and only the other day I was looking at some out our pics thinking that something was off on the frame dimensions|restaurants
Maybe this is my answer|restaurants
And I should get a better lens|restaurants
And a better flash|restaurants
And maybe I should read a book|restaurants
*Sigh*|restaurants

Tweets that mention London Eater – London food blog and restaurant reviews and restaurant guide » Wikio Gastronomy Rankings Preview July 2010 -- Topsy.com|restaurants
That’s kind of weird|restaurants
I wrote to them recently asking why my blog was number 950 in the rankings and a couple of weeks later it’s in the top 20? Something a bit nefarious about this…|restaurants
I wrote to them because to be frank, I found it odd that my blog was so low down in the rankings and much lesser known blogs were in the top 20|restaurants
My other blog The English Can Eat was something like number 5,500!!!|restaurants
Ultimately it’s all rubbish|restaurants
You write and photograph and tell your stories because you want to, you have something to say…|restaurants
msMarmitelover – Yeah I’m not entirely sure how it works to be quite honest|restaurants
I am led to believe that in addition to counting the feasible beans…there are also ‘magic numbers’ which Wikio uses in their algorithms to determine the rankings|restaurants
Although to be fair, all ranking methods are abit wonky anyway as they can vary widely depending on which they view carries more/less weight|restaurants
Like for example Compete.com , Alexa and even Google’s own PageRank algorithms all vary differently.|restaurants
Yeah, ultimately this is all for jokes really, I suppose people write because they have an opinion to voice, but also I think more importantly, that they feel they have something of value to add to the public domain.|restaurants
ish and chips is a national symbol. The reason I say so is because everybody has their own personal experience of it|restaurants
If you ask someone where their favourite chippie is, you’ll get this long gaze (like he’s going down memory lane), with a lowered voice, they go ‘i know this place…’|restaurants
You can tell from their facial expressions how much they enjoy it.|restaurants
The story usually ends with a polite nudge to pay a visit and proclamation that you wont be disappointed. Oh the joy of having found|restaurants
I grew up in a really small town on the other side of the world and as far away from england as can be|restaurants
But you know, I still remember my first brush with the old fish and chip combo|restaurants
It was in a ‘western restaurant’, as they are call it in asia, that served steaks roast chicken and the like. I ordered a large haddock and chips.|restaurants
The beauty is its simplicity. It can taste so good, when the batter is crispy, the steam gushing out on first cut and silky smooth fresh fish.|restaurants
As someone who doesnt have first hand experience with a real chippie, its all abit new to me, so I dont really have a stance over reinventions of this old tradition|restaurants
But as you will read from|restaurants
Established in 1939, according to esteemed crtics, it was a regular spot for old colleagues to unwind for a long, lazy lunch|restaurants
Last year, this place was taken over by the genius team of mark fuller and andy taylor with gary hollihead applying his michelin starred skills in the kitchen|restaurants
Geales is about a 5 minute walk from notting hill gate tube and is conveniently tucked away behind the cinema.|restaurants
are attempting a similar thing|restaurants
You can even find an excellent example at belgo’s in covent garden|restaurants
Though, I think the main difference at geales is that fish and chips takes centre stage. This hardworking dish has seemingly been given a slick makeover, abit like how a nostalgic tv show gets the silver screen treatment|restaurants
Think charlie’s angels, erm, mission impossible? Another great chef, Tom Aikens of chelsea attempted it in similar fashion at tom’s place, it would have been nice to try it, but sadly, the neighbours very recently brought about a shock closure.|restaurants
Lets get straight to the point, this review is about the main event|restaurants
If this doesnt work, everything else doesnt really matter|restaurants
Although, if you prefer, you can jump to|restaurants
to read about the co stars and if its added sparkle to the mix|restaurants
So on to the food|restaurants
We order double portion chips, double mushy peas on the side|restaurants
I had the cod and Nic went with the haddock.|restaurants
I believe the secret to getting really good chips is to double fry them, so they are crispy on the outside and use top quality spuds like maris piper to make them soft and fluffy on the inside|restaurants
Just look at the chips, they are an absolute beauty and they taste great|restaurants
But there’s the issue of price, that’s a double portion that costs £6|restaurants
Its abit steep, granted they do taste good, but is it justifiable paying a £5 premium to get chips that taste marginally better than burger king?|restaurants
Im no expert on mushy peas, but again its a double portion that costs £6…except this not very good. It was lumpy and rather bland; my canteen at work (yes, i have a real job) does this for free with the friday ‘fish of the day’ option|restaurants
And that taste alot better than what geales had to offer.|restaurants
So one out of two, how does the fish fare? It certainly photographs very well, served with sprinklings of sea salt on top, a slice of lemon and tartare sauce on the side.|restaurants
It didnt work for me|restaurants
I really wanted it to blow me away, but it just didnt|restaurants
Where was the gushing steam? I found a measly portion, covered by a thick batter with large pockets of air|restaurants
Gaps so large, I suspect the chef blew air in through a tiny hole while he was frying the fish|restaurants
At first i questioned the seasalt, but my first bite confirmed my fears, the fish was bland|restaurants
It really needed the salt.|restaurants
The batter was not up to scratch|restaurants
According to some of the critics, they say that because it wasnt fried in beef tallow, it’s not going to be great|restaurants
Well, they were right|restaurants
I was expecting the fish to be moist but it was a tad on the soggy side for me|restaurants
I was sorely disappointed because it just looked so good|restaurants
Im trying to convince myself that maybe mine was just a rare slip up and the next time I return it’ll be a much improved.|restaurants
What is your favourite meal? Doesnt have to be proper, just something that puts a smile on your face|restaurants
Can you think of it? Let me give you a hand.|restaurants
Close your eyes, picture it in your mind, let the shapes form, now slowly turn up the volume|restaurants
Are the surroundings hazy?|restaurants
Picture the people, tune them in, and let the colours flow, what does it taste of, describe it, like Hemingway does, you work up an appetite yet?|restaurants
I hear thumping,”Dinner in half an hour” its my mum’s voice coming from the kitchen|restaurants
She’s tenderlising meat the old fashion way|restaurants
I’m twelve and I’m running around the house, and i hear the sizzling sparkles, my mum is pan frying her world famous thinly sliced steaks|restaurants
Dinner time, my brother and I run to the table. What is that gorgeous smell?|restaurants
I have so many! One I was recently talking to my Mom about was when I was a kid and she would make corn fritters|restaurants
It would just make my day|restaurants
I started comfort eating at a very young age!|restaurants
For me, it’s fried chicken with fried dumplings (we called crumbs), mashed potatoes, and green beans|restaurants
My mom first soaked the chicken in milk, then diped them in flour seasoned with Lawry’s seasoning salt|restaurants
Then, they went into the hot oil of the frying pan|restaurants
She’d mix the leftover milk with the leftover flour to make a paste and then dropped the paste in little dots into the same oil|restaurants
These “crumbs” are, by far, my most favorite make me smile food memory.|restaurants
Oooh, oooh…I’ve so many I don’t know which one to list out first…but if I have to choose one, it’s the smell of pork meatballs being fried and then stir fried with potatoes and onions|restaurants
Yummy.|restaurants
I have it on good account that this is not a mere carbon copy of the great Chef’s Parisian offshoot, also called Dame de Pic near the Louvre, rather it is the more ambitious of the twins|restaurants
The great chef is of course Anne-Sophie Pic, she inherits a gastronomic dynasty so to speak with a long standing association with the bib, that stretches all the way to when they first revised (and introduced) their multi star rating system.|restaurants
Thought not her originally chosen path, she follows in the footsteps of her grandfather Andre, her father Jacques and eventually took over the kitchen from her brother Alain in 1998|restaurants
She received the coveted 3 stars in her own right in 2007|restaurants
She also owns another eponymous restaurant in Lausanne which currently holds 2 stars|restaurants
No small feat considering there are not many female chefs in pro kitchens, let alone ones who have reached the pinnacle of their profession|restaurants
We do have Clare Smyth over here, who will hopefully open her own doors, in the Summer|restaurants
Much in the spirit of the great Eugenie Brazier and Marie Bourgeois.|restaurants
And that will be enough wiki sleuthing, as we look to the present and the future with this latest venture, Pic’s first in Blighty in the brand new and very impressive Four Seasons at Trinity Square in Tower Hill.|restaurants
This is my first visit to a Pic restaurant, she does have many well-known dishes floating around the web that identifies her style as her own, with the incorporation of ingredients where you may, lets say, not expect them in a classic sense|restaurants
Not to mention her striking puddings, and I think particularly of the chocolate lattice and also the all-white millefeuille.|restaurants
Some of her top-end stuff (including the MF) as well as her family classics makes appearances at Dame London, and for this, she has entrusted it to an Italian, Luca Piscazzi|restaurants
He has La Pergola (Rome’s only 3 star), Amber HK and Apsleys, the previous occupant restaurant at Lanesborough before Eric Frechon moved in, on his resume.|restaurants
The wine list is… expensive|restaurants
I note that they do Latour BTG, on this visit, 2004 at £185 for 125ml|restaurants
This translates to a bottle price of £1110, which would be at least the 3x mark-up (to be optimistic)|restaurants
Bottom line is one thing, but value for money (compared to market price) is another, but I think this is a little too much for a relatively young Latour and especially considering the private club in the hotel is organised around the first growth, I expect more of a deal|restaurants
For that money, at least a 2000 perhaps|restaurants
The wine list (and the Latour discovery room) is looked after by somm Jan Konetzki, who has joined from Gordon Ramsay RHR.|restaurants
Meanwhile in the restaurant – in keeping with London – they have laid out a brasserie-like room that walks the tight rope of being gastronomic business and gastronomic casual|restaurants
Brown leather banquettes, towering pillars of stained glass and triple height ceilings.|restaurants
We visit for friday lunch, and ordered a 3 course meal|restaurants
My brother ate from the lunch concessions (£39 for three) and I ate from the ALC.|restaurants
A siphoned cauliflower puree midly spiced with ginger and generously topped with shavings of mimolette cheese and esplette pepper|restaurants
A simple but very delicious umami concoction.|restaurants
Grilled to golden brown crust and soft centre|restaurants
Classically paired with a hollandaise, albeit mildly infused with curry|restaurants
Yes|restaurants
Lovely work really and a good shout to stick these spears for the lunch set menu|restaurants
The white asparagus from the south of France now starting to come into peak season, that is to say quality and also a dive in prices.|restaurants
I asked our waitress to bring out a live one and was rather impressed that they did|restaurants
A beauty and such a precious thing|restaurants
Pretty big, looks about 150g, so I will say 4 head.|restaurants
Meuniere I think, and to a rare centre|restaurants
It’s very tender, retaining all of its natural briny sweetness|restaurants
The citrus provides freshness, and the deep (deep) dashi gives seasoning|restaurants
A hearty style for abalone, almost “rustic”, especially with the smoked potato puree hiding in the sauce, but the handiwork is excellent|restaurants
Generous portions, looks like a whole one in here|restaurants
I’m over the moon.|restaurants
‘s purer style is awesome, but of course, Pic’s preparation is equally a quality treatment for the noble product|restaurants
For those who bang on about quality produce, this is one such specimen|restaurants
In fact outside of Hedone and Bonhams, I don’t know if any other London restaurant offers Live abalone|restaurants
I hope you guys eat more of it, so more chefs over here will offer it|restaurants
They’re not as glamorous as Ise or Australian, but Irish and Breton abalones are pretty decent, in the right hands.|restaurants
Thighs on the lunch concessions set|restaurants
Works for me, the best cuts on the bird|restaurants
Presumably, the breasts go on the ALC plates and so it means the set lunch is both cheaper and the better choice! Beautifully roasted by the way, succulent and juicy.|restaurants
Perfectly cooked sole from Brixham, with a superb sauce|restaurants
Freshness of green apple rises to your olfactory (not unlike when you peel one) and ends with a subtle spectre of anise in the finish.|restaurants
I really like the sauce, it lifts the dish rather than interfere with the inherent quality of the fish|restaurants
Nothing clogging up the palate here, clean and clear cooking|restaurants
Solid * territory.|restaurants
Given the price tag, I would have liked Wye, Pertuis or perhaps even Roque-Hautes, used at her other restaurants|restaurants
These Kent ones were tasty nevertheless.|restaurants
Of course the reference point is Alain Ducasse, specifically Monaco, thought I have never had it before, so I won’t be able to add my value to it.|restaurants
For what it is worth, I thought the sponge was merely ordinary|restaurants
I like the seasonal addition of the gariguettes, as I have written recently in my last entry, they are beautiful and this very time of the year|restaurants
Superior fragrant, so much so, I think it almost a waste to manipulate them, as they are best eaten as they are.|restaurants
An atypical MF and very striking in its construction|restaurants
The ultimate homage to vanilla|restaurants
If not mistaken, it is not a creme pat enveloping the exterior, rather it is a whipped vanilla cream (with yoghurt), topped with meringue based icing|restaurants
Inside the puff, is a jasmine jelly, served ice cold, it is more like a sorbet layer|restaurants
In its entirety, there are textural, flavour and temperature gradients throughout|restaurants
The milk foam is subtly infused with pepper, emphasis on the subtle, and works well as a ‘finish’ on the palate|restaurants
A little interesting that this pepper (Voatsiperifery) is from Madagascar, and yet Pic has elected not to use Bourbon vanilla|restaurants
I would have thought that ingredients from the same terroir would have more affinity for one another, but well, maybe not, who knows.|restaurants
that it looks!) idea to change up the classic pudding with the cream plastered around the pastry|restaurants
And in London too|restaurants
I won’t list the top-tier MFs we now have in London|restaurants
Some are tall and traditional; others lay flat and impossibly light, with ice creams that do not ‘melt’|restaurants
You know where they are.|restaurants
The bill came to £162.32 for 2 people for all food, 1 beer, 1 glass of Alsatian Pinot Blanc, a bottle of water and service|restaurants
The set lunch half of the bill was around £50, and an ALC meal came in at £110.|restaurants
The cooking is very good here, easily in the 1 star bracket IMHO|restaurants
If this is truly a reflection of Pic’s palate, then I would say the Chef has a great one|restaurants
The cuisine is of course very French, but it is her use of subtle non-traditional flavour pairings that really brighten the recipes|restaurants
I like that the cuisine is quite compact, allowing main ingredients to taste naturally as they should|restaurants
There is nothing over the top here and nothing is out of control – which is testament to Luca’s management of the team.|restaurants
Their sourcing is good, especially for fish, featuring the best of the West Country, Scotland and plugging the holes in British terrior, with French produce|restaurants
I would liken this to Les 110 somewhat in ‘conception’ and in terms of the relaxed ambiance|restaurants
Though the reality is that DdPL is a more ambitious outfit (it is the Four Seasons after all), and this is obviously reflected in the difference in bottom line|restaurants
Over time, I am keen to see the menu change up and to see more of Pic’s signature dishes pop-up here|restaurants
It is nearly the summer, might we see soft-shell native Cornish lobsters in Pic’s red fruit dashi perhaps? It would fit in quite well with what DdPL is about, I think.|restaurants
The full prices may make you wince, but I must say that they have put quite some effort into their lunch menus and provide ample value for money, considering what’s on the plate|restaurants
The weekday 3 courses for £39 is superb, but the next time I return, I will be looking closely at the Weekend 4 course lunch for £55|restaurants
Both the sole and millefeuille are on the weekend lunch set|restaurants
Well worth a visit.|restaurants
I love the research and detail you put into this post as well as your others, this personally isn’t my type of cuisine but still very much enjoyed reading it and may visit on a special occasion 🙂|restaurants
Agree with Christian|restaurants
Through your blog, I can see the amount of time and energy put in to making this post that’s very insightful for people who are interested about this restaurant or generally the places to visit in London.|restaurants
Just booked in for the end of the month , I`ll be happy if it looks and tastes like your meal|restaurants
I`ll most probably go for the tasting menu so I can get a taste of what Pic`s cuisine is all about.|restaurants
Hello folks, I am officially back from my month long vacation, trust you have applied yourselves positively while I’ve been away|restaurants
My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year|restaurants
I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff|restaurants
Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold|restaurants
Bling|restaurants
I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent|restaurants
I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money|restaurants
I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine|restaurants
It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours|restaurants
Something as common as say pizza for example – I can’t say I’ve actually tried a Neapolitan recipe passed down from the ages|restaurants
This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against|restaurants
And so Kang’s quest to catch a glimpse into the world of Taiwanese cuisine was born|restaurants
Here are his notes (So weird writing in the third person).|restaurants
The scene is Taipei|restaurants
The capital of the island republic, it is situated on the Northern tip of the country and its name unsurprisingly translates to ‘Northern Taiwan’|restaurants
Home to 2.6 million, it is an emerging ultra modern metropolis of Blade Runner style concrete jungle and it’s skyline proudly accomodates Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world|restaurants
Like all cities, there are shades of vintage buildings still lingering underneath all the shiny metal and glass|restaurants
Old shop houses prop up the neon signs, lighting up the city’s night like a Christmas tree|restaurants
It’s wonderfully urban, tight street corners just wide enough for cars to pass through and temperamental rainclouds which make London feel like Cyprus|restaurants
In the belly of the beast lies a diverse range of restaurant, cafés and their famed night markets which play host to hundreds of independent street food vendors making it a sort of foodie’s wet dream|restaurants
In fact, there is so much diversity in it’s food, a week is simply not enough time to try everything|restaurants
But I tried anyway|restaurants
My excursion wouldn’t be as impactful if not for my extended family taking me around the city, so I have the C and C’s to thank for all the recs.|restaurants
With Londoners experiencing a spike in Sichuan food, I thought it’d be appropriate that our first stop was Chuan Ba Zhe – a Szechuan restaurant that does all-you-can-eat ‘Ma-la’ hotpots for about 8 per head.|restaurants
The local flavour – Gold Medal Beer|restaurants
The brew is light and carries a chrysanthemum sweetness about it – very easy drinking stuff|restaurants
We started with a selection of ‘small dishes’ to share dishes and to start – something which is characteristic of a Taiwanese meal – including Kousiu (Saliva) chicken , Quaiwei (weird taste) vermicelli, Dou gan zhe (bean curd slices) and Mala tripe|restaurants
As it was a Szechuan restaurant, everything was red in colour, evident of potent sliced chilli everywhere and the tranquilising effect of Szechuan pepper slowly started to grab hold of my tastebuds|restaurants
Terrifying.|restaurants
The main highlight of the meal was the all-you-can-eat hotpot, the freeloading aspect in that we could order as much meat or vegetables we wanted to chuck into the soup.|restaurants
Now, this is properly spicy stuff|restaurants
The soup was made with szechuan pepper and as I alluded to earlier, doesn’t just burn your tongue and throat, it actually conjures up a strange numbing sensation that firstly starts on the back of your tongue, and if you’re greedy, works it’s way into the back of your throat|restaurants
I downed several glasses of gold medal beer to put the fire out|restaurants
Eventually, I couldn’t feel my tastebuds anymore|restaurants
If you head to Angelis in Kilburn or|restaurants
in Earls Court, you’ll be able get your hands on a Ma-la hotpot|restaurants
It’s usually protocol to have a layer of oil floating on top of the soup, it’s suppose to keep the heat in and also to cook whatever you’ve dunked into the soup|restaurants
I am certain that London restaurants hold back on the peppers – this place didn’t.|restaurants
We rode the MRT – Taipei’s equivalent of the tube – to Danshui and to the very end of the line|restaurants
The town is a scenic getaway from the high tech city of Taipei|restaurants
Here, people rolled around in vespas and flip flops and beyond the bridges, you can watch fishermen barbecueing their triumphs by the beach|restaurants
Restaurants lined the coast, and as we went on a Sunday, it was as if all of Taipei had descended upon this area|restaurants
We had trekked all the way here to visit the Black Shop, and to sample the locally celebrated pork chop rice.|restaurants
A large bowl of their signature pork chop costs two pounds, less if our political system was in better working order|restaurants
Like all umami infused food – this bowl of rice smelled hearty, rustic and fragrant|restaurants
Served piping hot, the large flap of chop garnished with bean braised tofu and pickled cabbage that carried a vinegary stink|restaurants
The rice was glutinous, almost sushi rice (but I daren’t claim it) and the savoury flouriness of the pork chop was unmistakable|restaurants
There was a thin outer which encapsulated the piece of meat, eggs must have been used and the coating absorbed alot of moisture leading to a juiciness which softened the texture of the pork|restaurants
The combination of the bean-flavoured tofu, the vinegary pickled cabbage and the soya infused egginess of the porkchop gave way to an exemplary example of umami… I finished two bowls.|restaurants
The black shop was still entertaining massive queues at 3pm in the afternoon, and this was a huge restaurant spread over two floors – such was the popularity of it’s pork chop rice|restaurants
While there, it was also an opportunity to give one of Taiwan’s best – if common – small dishes a try : Cold creamy tofu with sweet century egg.|restaurants
When I say creamy, I mean really creamy|restaurants
The texture is so consistent, it hardly broke and is akin to the density of say a pannacota|restaurants
Flavoured with a sweetened soya sauce, the purity of the tofu melds well with the mushy liverness of the preserved duck eggs|restaurants
The strength of this dish – in my opinion – is dependent on the quality of the tofu|restaurants
The real deal, everything in London is a mere imitation.|restaurants
We headed out bright and early the next day so that I could run a few errands while in Taipei|restaurants
Things are generally cheaper, I had my Seiko Kinetic fixed for just under £40 compared to a whopping £85 minimum if I sent it to Maidenhead|restaurants
I also had bought a pair of thick black rimmed glasses – Clark Kent style – for a reasonable price…|restaurants
yes, as if Gary Rhodes would suddenly recognised me attempting to ‘review’ his restaurant, says my ego.|restaurants
We went to Jiang Jia, not particular special, nor exciting but it was something distinctly local and also open 24 hours a day.|restaurants
A bowl of salty soya milk made with pickled lettuce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, maldive fish and a tiny splash of soya sauce – definitely a change from the rock sugar syrup of HK style sweet tofufa|restaurants
My favourite were the glutinous rice roll stuffed with pork floss and pickled radish|restaurants
I thought it was interesting to have a dough explosion of sorts with a youtiaw – fried dough – stuffed with a chinese style omelette on a sesame crusted bread roll – called a ‘shao bing you tiew jia dan’ or otherwise a chinese breakfast butty perhaps.|restaurants
I spent alot of time getting lost in the side streets which hid makeshift markets and the occasional street food vendor, photographing this street life proved to be one of the highlights of my visit to Taipei.|restaurants
All I could see was the romance of the older parts of Taipei, so rustic, raw and human, it was here that I felt the life and the buzz of the real city.|restaurants
We have now just got off Dingxi station and my other half and decided to take me to one of her old favourite noodle shops|restaurants
Small, unassuming and humble|restaurants
There would be nothing high brow about it, but again the attraction was apparent in it’s unpretension, just so real.|restaurants
And here, I had tasted one of the best spare rib & taro soups to date|restaurants
The soup was oily, but filled with meaty and stocky flavours – very homely|restaurants
Like most of the soupy meats I had sampled in Taipei, the spare ribs melted like ice cream.|restaurants
Finally, our last destination led us to the Golden Formosa, famous for none other than authentic Taiwanese cuisine, and I was assured that it doesnt get more authentic, or local than this.|restaurants
There are several variations of the ‘White-Cut’ Chicken in the different types of Chinese cuisine, and it so happens to be a local favourite in Taiwan, which claims a variation of their own|restaurants
It’s a mainstay in Cantonese cooking and is a sort of a national symbol of Singapore cuisine in which it is referred to as Hainanese Chicken|restaurants
The skin is salty and oily, but the meat is juice heaven and silky smooth|restaurants
There is rich chicken flavour and a clinical taste on the palate|restaurants
The chicken bounces with every bite and is just a joy to eat – getting breast meat to soften up is a family secret, and the breast meat at Golden formosa was much like caressing the equivalent assets of a beautifully woman, or…|restaurants
What is aromatic to a Taiwanese person just reeked to my untrained palate|restaurants
This dish stank of bamboo shoots and vinegar, the tripe added to the soured livery flavours of this dish|restaurants
It was a difficult mouthful for me, not my cup of tea this one, but about as Taiwanese as it could get.|restaurants
I think the thick gravy – slimy and very fishy – was probably made from the juices scallop and the oyster|restaurants
It was like a runny pizza with a dough that absorbed too much moisture|restaurants
Very potent, I could only have a slice before the fishiness became overwhelming.|restaurants
This one I really enjoyed – one of the most memorable dishes from my trip|restaurants
Crunchy popcorn like exterior, bubbly crispiness and a peppery hit with a worschester sauce tang|restaurants
I am certain that there was curry powder in the mixture and which which really gave ribs a spice of life|restaurants
The meat still juicy on the inside but the distinct sour and spicy crackle on the outside.|restaurants
So that was my trip to Taipei|restaurants
The most memorable meal has got to be the Pork Chop rice – simple food, but oh so good|restaurants
In addition to this, I wrote up on one of Taiwan’s greatest treasure –|restaurants
at three of Taipei’s most respected Beef noodle houses|restaurants
Alright, well a belated happy new year of the Tiger folks, hope you enjoyed my adventures away from home|restaurants
I think it’s about time I got back to writing up about London again|restaurants
See you monday.|restaurants
I have fond memories of eating pork chop rice in those ben dung that are served on trains in Taiwan|restaurants
 Did you try any zen bing on your trip?  [My pinyin is haphazard – zen bing are those ‘chinese burritos’ that you can get at street markets in Taipei.]|restaurants
Very interesting blog post – Taiwanese food is not something you hear a lot about|restaurants
Makes me want to explore tofu a whole lot more though, particularly as a seasoning.|restaurants
Your thoughts on the extreme fishy/vinegary flavours were probably about right too – I reckon people from outside Europe/US might feel the same about Stinking Bishop, Stilton, Vacherin etc.|restaurants
Can I ask where you went for the spare ribs and taro soup? The wife is very keen on trying that|restaurants
Anything else worth eating in that shop?|restaurants
Wild Boar – The place is called Da Jia Hao (or everybody good in chinese!)|restaurants
You come out of the MRT station Dingxi (MRT Orange Line) , I think it’s exit number 1, up the escalator, its on the left hand side and you will see the place ‘through the window’ as you are going up the escalator…|restaurants
more confusing that it sounds, but trust me it should make more sense when you guys get there, basically it’s in a separate building just outside the station 🙂 Ahh… when you are in DingXi make sure try THE original soya milk shop called ‘Dou Jiang Da Wang’|restaurants
The directions… are difficult to describe, but it’s a five minute walk from the station (Dingxi) and any local in the area should know this place, very popular… ok good luck and hope you enjoy it!!!|restaurants
Am in Singapore right now and was just feasting on ‘Hainanese Chicken’ rice for lunch a moment ago|restaurants
I have always thought that the dish originated from the Malayan Straits but perhaps I am mistaken|restaurants
I mean, it’s essentially poached chicken isn’t it? In fact, I first heard of White Cut Chicken (or ‘bai qie ji’) when a Hongkong colleague mentioned it to me in London|restaurants
lol.|restaurants
Great write up! I am taking my first trip to Taiwan in a few weeks time, so your post will make great reference material!|restaurants
An American in London – Taipei is a great place for food, so much to eat! Zen bing? Is the bread white, soft and fluffy? Nope, don’t think I tried it on this trip!|restaurants
London Chow – Yeah, essentially the same recipe of poached chicken|restaurants
I did a bit of research and I think that there are several variations of this recipe, with each cuisine claiming a version of it, and I think there are a few twists and touches with each version|restaurants
I know for a fact that Bai Zhan Chicken is part and parcel of Hainan cuisine… because my grandfather is from Hainan and he passed down a family recipe to my aunts and uncles (my grandfather is a chef, my dad doesnt cook)|restaurants
In Taiwan, I believe the recipe came from parts of southern China, probably in a similar fashion as Niu Rou Mien.|restaurants
Oh not fluffy, etc|restaurants
 Zen bing really is like a burrito|restaurants
 You get a flour pancake (almost like a flour tortilla, but a bit tougher – hot off the griddle), and it’s filled with a little rice, veg, egg, chinese sausage – whatever you like, really|restaurants
 The best part, in my opinion, was always the crushed peanuts/peanut powder to add crunch and sweet nuttiness|restaurants
 It’s great stuff and I’d recommend looking out for it next time you’re in Tapiei|restaurants
 [I used to spend summers in Taipei when I was little.]|restaurants
i think AAIL is referring to ‘jian bing’|restaurants

This is such a great post, Taiwanese food is always so flavoursome and seasoned! I wonder if you ever found hujiao bing in London, can you let me know?|restaurants
with a series of images that were taken completely inside the various restaurants that I had visited throughout 2009 and 2010|restaurants
You might even recognise some dishes in these photographs.|restaurants
entirely in portrait orientation, and all are based on the 8×10 frame, as opposed to the 8x11ish full-frame that the 35mm format offers|restaurants
I’ve done so because I feel that the 8×10 frame emphasises food very well, it’s shorter and a more logical frame to me… plus it fits an A4 page very well.|restaurants
I also keep a number of photography related articles on my portfolio site – like using a Leica M9 to shoot food for instance – so please feel free to pay a visit to|restaurants
if you like my food photography (or just like staring at food photos in general) and please keep me in mind if you have a photography job to carry out|restaurants
Especially if you are a restaurant.|restaurants
Kang Kang Kang|restaurants
The way you reel off all these amazing food pictures makes it seem like its so easy to you|restaurants
8 x 10 is a nice format and only the other day I was looking at some out our pics thinking that something was off on the frame dimensions|restaurants
Maybe this is my answer|restaurants
And I should get a better lens|restaurants
And a better flash|restaurants
And maybe I should read a book|restaurants

Hello folks, I am officially back from my month long vacation, trust you have applied yourselves positively while I’ve been away|restaurants
My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year|restaurants
I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff|restaurants
Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold|restaurants
Bling|restaurants
I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent|restaurants
I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money|restaurants
I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine|restaurants
It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours|restaurants
Something as common as say pizza for example – I can’t say I’ve actually tried a Neapolitan recipe passed down from the ages|restaurants
This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against|restaurants
And so Kang’s quest to catch a glimpse into the world of Taiwanese cuisine was born|restaurants
Here are his notes (So weird writing in the third person).|restaurants
The scene is Taipei|restaurants
The capital of the island republic, it is situated on the Northern tip of the country and its name unsurprisingly translates to ‘Northern Taiwan’|restaurants
Home to 2.6 million, it is an emerging ultra modern metropolis of Blade Runner style concrete jungle and it’s skyline proudly accomodates Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world|restaurants
Like all cities, there are shades of vintage buildings still lingering underneath all the shiny metal and glass|restaurants
Old shop houses prop up the neon signs, lighting up the city’s night like a Christmas tree|restaurants
It’s wonderfully urban, tight street corners just wide enough for cars to pass through and temperamental rainclouds which make London feel like Cyprus|restaurants
In the belly of the beast lies a diverse range of restaurant, cafés and their famed night markets which play host to hundreds of independent street food vendors making it a sort of foodie’s wet dream|restaurants
In fact, there is so much diversity in it’s food, a week is simply not enough time to try everything|restaurants
But I tried anyway|restaurants
My excursion wouldn’t be as impactful if not for my extended family taking me around the city, so I have the C and C’s to thank for all the recs.|restaurants
With Londoners experiencing a spike in Sichuan food, I thought it’d be appropriate that our first stop was Chuan Ba Zhe – a Szechuan restaurant that does all-you-can-eat ‘Ma-la’ hotpots for about 8 per head.|restaurants
The local flavour – Gold Medal Beer|restaurants
The brew is light and carries a chrysanthemum sweetness about it – very easy drinking stuff|restaurants
We started with a selection of ‘small dishes’ to share dishes and to start – something which is characteristic of a Taiwanese meal – including Kousiu (Saliva) chicken , Quaiwei (weird taste) vermicelli, Dou gan zhe (bean curd slices) and Mala tripe|restaurants
As it was a Szechuan restaurant, everything was red in colour, evident of potent sliced chilli everywhere and the tranquilising effect of Szechuan pepper slowly started to grab hold of my tastebuds|restaurants
Terrifying.|restaurants
The main highlight of the meal was the all-you-can-eat hotpot, the freeloading aspect in that we could order as much meat or vegetables we wanted to chuck into the soup.|restaurants
Now, this is properly spicy stuff|restaurants
The soup was made with szechuan pepper and as I alluded to earlier, doesn’t just burn your tongue and throat, it actually conjures up a strange numbing sensation that firstly starts on the back of your tongue, and if you’re greedy, works it’s way into the back of your throat|restaurants
I downed several glasses of gold medal beer to put the fire out|restaurants
Eventually, I couldn’t feel my tastebuds anymore|restaurants
If you head to Angelis in Kilburn or|restaurants
in Earls Court, you’ll be able get your hands on a Ma-la hotpot|restaurants
It’s usually protocol to have a layer of oil floating on top of the soup, it’s suppose to keep the heat in and also to cook whatever you’ve dunked into the soup|restaurants
I am certain that London restaurants hold back on the peppers – this place didn’t.|restaurants
We rode the MRT – Taipei’s equivalent of the tube – to Danshui and to the very end of the line|restaurants
The town is a scenic getaway from the high tech city of Taipei|restaurants
Here, people rolled around in vespas and flip flops and beyond the bridges, you can watch fishermen barbecueing their triumphs by the beach|restaurants
Restaurants lined the coast, and as we went on a Sunday, it was as if all of Taipei had descended upon this area|restaurants
We had trekked all the way here to visit the Black Shop, and to sample the locally celebrated pork chop rice.|restaurants
A large bowl of their signature pork chop costs two pounds, less if our political system was in better working order|restaurants
Like all umami infused food – this bowl of rice smelled hearty, rustic and fragrant|restaurants
Served piping hot, the large flap of chop garnished with bean braised tofu and pickled cabbage that carried a vinegary stink|restaurants
The rice was glutinous, almost sushi rice (but I daren’t claim it) and the savoury flouriness of the pork chop was unmistakable|restaurants
There was a thin outer which encapsulated the piece of meat, eggs must have been used and the coating absorbed alot of moisture leading to a juiciness which softened the texture of the pork|restaurants
The combination of the bean-flavoured tofu, the vinegary pickled cabbage and the soya infused egginess of the porkchop gave way to an exemplary example of umami… I finished two bowls.|restaurants
The black shop was still entertaining massive queues at 3pm in the afternoon, and this was a huge restaurant spread over two floors – such was the popularity of it’s pork chop rice|restaurants
While there, it was also an opportunity to give one of Taiwan’s best – if common – small dishes a try : Cold creamy tofu with sweet century egg.|restaurants
When I say creamy, I mean really creamy|restaurants
The texture is so consistent, it hardly broke and is akin to the density of say a pannacota|restaurants
Flavoured with a sweetened soya sauce, the purity of the tofu melds well with the mushy liverness of the preserved duck eggs|restaurants
The strength of this dish – in my opinion – is dependent on the quality of the tofu|restaurants
The real deal, everything in London is a mere imitation.|restaurants
We headed out bright and early the next day so that I could run a few errands while in Taipei|restaurants
Things are generally cheaper, I had my Seiko Kinetic fixed for just under £40 compared to a whopping £85 minimum if I sent it to Maidenhead|restaurants
I also had bought a pair of thick black rimmed glasses – Clark Kent style – for a reasonable price…|restaurants
yes, as if Gary Rhodes would suddenly recognised me attempting to ‘review’ his restaurant, says my ego.|restaurants
We went to Jiang Jia, not particular special, nor exciting but it was something distinctly local and also open 24 hours a day.|restaurants
A bowl of salty soya milk made with pickled lettuce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, maldive fish and a tiny splash of soya sauce – definitely a change from the rock sugar syrup of HK style sweet tofufa|restaurants
My favourite were the glutinous rice roll stuffed with pork floss and pickled radish|restaurants
I thought it was interesting to have a dough explosion of sorts with a youtiaw – fried dough – stuffed with a chinese style omelette on a sesame crusted bread roll – called a ‘shao bing you tiew jia dan’ or otherwise a chinese breakfast butty perhaps.|restaurants
I spent alot of time getting lost in the side streets which hid makeshift markets and the occasional street food vendor, photographing this street life proved to be one of the highlights of my visit to Taipei.|restaurants
All I could see was the romance of the older parts of Taipei, so rustic, raw and human, it was here that I felt the life and the buzz of the real city.|restaurants
We have now just got off Dingxi station and my other half and decided to take me to one of her old favourite noodle shops|restaurants

What is aromatic to a Taiwanese person just reeked to my untrained palate|restaurants

It was a difficult mouthful for me, not my cup of tea this one, but about as Taiwanese as it could get.|restaurants

I’m twelve and I’m running around the house, and i hear the sizzling sparkles, my mum is pan frying her world famous thinly sliced steaks|restaurants
Dinner time, my brother and I run to the table. What is that gorgeous smell?|restaurants
I have so many! One I was recently talking to my Mom about was when I was a kid and she would make corn fritters|restaurants
It would just make my day|restaurants
I started comfort eating at a very young age!|restaurants
For me, it’s fried chicken with fried dumplings (we called crumbs), mashed potatoes, and green beans|restaurants
My mom first soaked the chicken in milk, then diped them in flour seasoned with Lawry’s seasoning salt|restaurants
Then, they went into the hot oil of the frying pan|restaurants
She’d mix the leftover milk with the leftover flour to make a paste and then dropped the paste in little dots into the same oil|restaurants
These “crumbs” are, by far, my most favorite make me smile food memory.|restaurants
Oooh, oooh…I’ve so many I don’t know which one to list out first…but if I have to choose one, it’s the smell of pork meatballs being fried and then stir fried with potatoes and onions|restaurants

What is your favourite meal? Doesnt have to be proper, just something that puts a smile on your face|restaurants
Can you think of it? Let me give you a hand.|restaurants
Close your eyes, picture it in your mind, let the shapes form, now slowly turn up the volume|restaurants
Are the surroundings hazy?|restaurants
Picture the people, tune them in, and let the colours flow, what does it taste of, describe it, like Hemingway does, you work up an appetite yet?|restaurants
