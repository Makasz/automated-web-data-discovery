Unfortunately the new owners at Bonhams had a change of heart and rather abruptly decided to shut the restaurant at the end of 2018|Bonhams
Only to have another change of heart, to (puzzlingly) put in something apparently trendy (at least it isnt skewers and sandwiches, I suppose), less ambitious and in the process had consciously dumped one of the few worthy michelin restaurants in London that practiced proper classic technique and bought in whole fish and poultry.|restaurants
Will Lander and the Portland crew have now recently settled in for their little Italian bistro, and while i like my tortelini il brodo, I wish Will and Dan all the best with their latest gig of course, but I will now turn my attention to Horsham (of all places), as that is where the great Tom Kemble has decided to take the next step in his culinary game.|Horsham
Some of you will know the hotel, South Lodge belonging to a group of country hotels with capable chefs attached, such as Matt Worswick at The Latymer|The Latymer
While others will no doubt have visited The Pass at Southlodge, when it was run by Matt Gillan, formerly of GBM fame and also recipient of a michelin star.|The Pass
Tom inherits Matt’s old digs, its USP being the relative borderless gap between the diners sitting on high table top banquettes and the kitchen, separated by carefully placed glass panels (installed by Tom and co).|restaurants
Having started here since the start of 2019, he has settled in with the new kitchen, new team and rather refreshingly his cuisine is now evolving, or more precisely, left unshackled by Bonhams’ rather conservative clientele tastes|Bonhams
He is now more freely injecting his wholly minimalist style with touches of Japanese methods, as well as developing new cooking techniques which were otherwise impossible in the Bonhams basement kitchen.|Bonhams
Product quality and insistence on a la minute cooking is still the focus of his cuisine, to this point, since Tom is now closer to the South coast, he’s taking full advantage of this by sourcing from relative proximity – seabass and scallops being two examples.|restaurants
At Bonhams, there was always the careful preservation of natural flavours, today, he layers with a sleuth of rice vinegars, dashis and other layers of flavours to progress the overall delivery of his dishes|Bonhams
One other fundamental new string that Tom has incorporated in his repertoire is premium smoke in the form of a new konro grill that takes binchotan|restaurants
He showed us a few dishes, of the ones that stood out for me, were the oyster with smoked Chantilly cream as well as the lobster – cooked in shell to a perfect mi-cuit centre, and imbued with a very subtle lacing of smoke|restaurants
Lovely cuisson, but it gets better as he matches the lobster with a heart racing bone-marrow and madeira sauce – Tom’s idea of a surf and turf.|restaurants
To finish, Tom demos his latest pudding developments, a homage to Stephen Harris’ much loved chocolate mousse|restaurants
Tom extrapolates the chaud-froid effect with a super clean milk sorbet, passionfruit gel and pump street chocolate thats been fried to a crispy sub-cooled temperature by liquid nitrogen (which he also inherits from Matt G)|restaurants
As with The Sportsman, the warm chocolate mousse is very light, as it is pushed through a whipper.|restaurants
Coffee is by Difference Coffee, Tom is offering either the stock beans or blue mountain (though I personally like the Hawaiian stuff), and caviar is Attilus, just like at The Latymer|he Latymer
Wine will take some time to come along as its part of the Hotel’s charge, but all in all, it is very exciting.|restaurants
If you are like me, and have also enjoyed his restraint cooking at Bonhams, I recommend popping down to Horsham to give the new Kembler a spin|Bonhams, Horsham
Where in the past at Bonhams, he had kept things minimal and flavours classic (with his salt marsh lamb in July onwards), here he has stepped up intensity and complexity, layering up the umami and balancing with the coolness of the yoghurt|Bonhams
Ultimately it’s a dish that embraces flavour, and was satisfying way to end the savouries|restaurants

Due to location, Ikoyi is most definitely not cheap, but you do get what you paid for|Ikoyi

Bjorn Frantzén was in London for one night only, pitching up at Bibendum’s on a tuesday night in May to do a collaboration with our Claude Bosi|Bibendum
I was rather excited about it, a dinner with two two leading lights in gastronomy at the peak of their powers, in the same very kitchen cooking the meal was something to experience.|restaurants
However, the menu itself did cost half a kidney, at £280pp, plus service and drinks, we ended up paying about £414pp for this meal (we drank a bottle of 2009 Aligote from Leroy).|restaurants
I have been very curious about Bjorn’s cuisine for a while now – all the photos of his dishes look top notch, grandiose French-Kaiseiki cuisine with peak condition produce from the ice cold waters around Scandinavia|restaurants
 Bjorn had brought the entire Stockholm team over, and they had split the kitchen and the pass into two halves|restaurants
Franco was on side with Claude on their side of the pass, and Marcus Jenmark headed the other side.|restaurants
As for the dinner – absolutely brilliant|restaurants
Even with a sneak preview of his dishes, you can really see why this guy is Sweden’s first three star chef|restaurants
Very curious about getting to Stockholm after this showing.|restaurants
that is if I can get a table at Restaurant Frantzen.|Restaurant Frantzen

No doubt Hibiscus fans will school me on the versions you’ve had at Maddox street|Maddox
If you know Hibiscus, then you know Claude has never been afraid to push the boundaries|Hibiscus
In this case, a genius move that paid off tremendously|restaurants
Also I went with 3 mates, so technically it’s 41 x £10 – cost of meal for myself|restaurants
Still, it is cheaper than travelling to Stockholm, as well as having a meal at Bosi and Frantzen separately.|Bosi,Frantzen
It’s been over a year since Wagyu Mafia crew were in London to ‘perform’ (in their vernacular) a one-off event (titled Grilleasy) for the OAD awards ceremony for the|Wagyu Mafi
It was a fantastic evening with this crew’s first (of many, I hope) London event, in which they pulled together an exciting showcase of wagyu through a myriad of cuts, culminating with 80 day aged sirloin simply grilled in a josper, and of course their famous Kobe fillet cutlet sandwich|restaurants
The meal also featured all other cuts including round, ribeye cap, tail, shank, chuck, ribeye, sirloin, fillet and its prized fat (in an old fashioned no less)|restaurants
Hamada san’s Ozaki (as in Mr Ozaki’s beef to be exact|Ozaki

Pictures and descriptions from a revisit to Ben Marks’ ever improving Perilla|Perilla
This time, I asked Ben if he would  make his Blackbird dish which he entered for GBM 2019, to which he kindly obliged|restaurants
I’ve been thoroughly impressed by the young Chef’s progression ever since he started up a few years ago in Stoke Newington|restaurants
Perilla has flourished into an exciting restaurant to dine at, whilst still remaining amazingly affordable, and I have no doubt we will see more accolades go to Ben’s name as he and his business partner Matt Emmerson continue to solidify their reputation in British gastronomy.|Perilla
Steve Drake is someone whose been round the block, yet because he has operated outside of London for most of his career as head chef, he has remained relatively under the radar, even though this seasoned, talented Chef is anything but when it comes to his cooking chops|restaurants
A Roux scholar, he has trained under many a legend in British gastronomy, including at Chez Nico, The Oak Room with MPW and has had stints with Alain Passard and at L’Auberge de L’Eridan in France.|Chez Nico,The Oak Room,L’Auberge de L’Eridan
