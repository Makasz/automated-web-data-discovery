If you don’t want chilli make a simple herb oil by blending a flavourful herb (like oregano or basil) with some oil, allowing it to infuse and then pass it through a coffee filter or similar and you are good to go.

Hot/Cold chocolate variations with milk sorbet and passionfruit gel Tom inherited the open kitchen from Gillan’s days (still seen here while he gets his new gig going), the restaurant is relatively small, a couple steps from the banquette high tables to his pass, so there is a sense you’re almost in there. He also inherited liquid nitrogen, nice crockery,all part of the genesis, or shall we say the presentation of it, as he summoned us to into the kitchen for pudding …and I thought i’d never see the day Kembler did modernist. Jack is on pastry, turn it up 🔊 , you’ll hear Tom give a quick run down of the dish as Jack prepares it. An homage to @sportsmankent Stephen Harris’ warm chocolate mousse (also iSi whipper) with milk ice cream, & ongoing development with @pumpstreetchocolate (72%Bourbon mousse) , with a very clean milk sorbet from his Bonhams days (made with creme crue, which I love). – Firstly, the pudding is gorgeous in its simplicity – and a very pure milk chocolate. Chaud/froid study of contrasting temperatures, warm mousse to ice cold cream to nitro cold crumble (so to speak). Served in a bowl, the whole thing yields pure satisfaction – the spoon eases in smooth, snappy tuile then mousse(swipe 👉). I mopped it up in seconds. A true pud. I generally avoid a heavy chocolate, but this is notable in that you get the sinful comfort, but come away with a light finish. Secondly, and perhaps more so, the interaction works especially well for this one. Rather than for show, Tom’s used the nitrogen to refry the chocolate, so there is an element of la minute prep that’s integral to the eating experience. As the dining room is so close, its easy for people to pop into the kitchen to see their pud being put together, and it totally works well as a finale to the taster menu. Also, notice Tom casually showing off his perfect rochers, two in a row.🌟..🌟. Hope Stephen tries this one day, I’m pretty sure he’ll be pretty happy with it. I most certainly was. @tfkemble @jack_robey1996 @aaronmcnamara_91 @greground1 @south_lodge #horshamrestaurants #eaterlondon @eaterlondon #lefooding #sushikemble

Then simmered in dashi, sherry vinegar, kaffir lime. Claws and tail poached in the stock and then all the precious juices are saved and all poured back into the soup. Shells are then toasted on a dry pan until it just starts to smoulder. Then it is all chucked into the stock. Topped with water on the odd occasion, only a touch of salt and then simmered for a day. The noble shellfish’s sheer purity of natural sweetness never ceases to amaze me. Finally it is sieved. Touch of paprika, lemon, cream and butter, blitzed with a hand food processor, et voila, bowl of liquid joy.

While it is vogue for today’s European based chefs to borrow (heavily) from the Japanese (dashis, vinegars, seaweed), Jeremy Chan has chosen an altogether different route to peak umami via Jollof cuisine. It might be highly presumptuous of me to offer Jeremy as the modern day version of Olivier Roellinger; classic techniques with a growing knowledge of spices… though quite some way before Chan reaches Roellinger’s legend status.

For me, I think of it as Modern European with Nigerian spices and vegetables, but the terroir is most definitely British, and it makes this very much a London restaurant. The guys have been chipping away at their little project for about 2 years now, and I think Jeremy has now begun shaping something that is both delicious and uniquely his own. Not so easy to stand out in this realm with so much Gastronomic history already cataloged today, but Jeremy and Iré have just about pulled it off.

It really was superiorly comforting, the ultimate comfort food feels, leave me in a room with a spoon and couple of bowls of this, I would happily polish it all off and ask for more. To cut the richness, there is a dose of acidity, which I assume is from the mead gel, and a little freshness from citrus zest. Topped with the best cut of chicken, two nuggets from it’s back.

If I am to be honest, personally, the coffee sauce seemed excessive, as a light jus with some more freshness would have sufficed for me, though it didn’t detract from the brilliance of the protein itself. It was seriously a pristinely cooked tenderloin. Beef so often is a boring choice for a taster menu, but not this one. A bold dish!

The meal also featured all other cuts including round, ribeye cap, tail, shank, chuck, ribeye, sirloin, fillet and its prized fat (in an old fashioned no less).

Given that I was in both countries for this trip, i grabbed the chance to experience both restaurants back to back. Kawate san has entrusted logy’s slick open counter kitchen – mirroring Florilege’s own – to Ryogo Tahara, his former sous for the last 3 years, naming it to signify the blending of Asian culture, grounded in Taiwanese soil.

Like Florilege, Tahara san’s cuisine is modern and unique, yet it is realised mostly through classic technique and showcases his ongoing study of the riches of Taiwanese produce.

It is worth mentioning that Florilege has an excellent option for a soft pairing flight.

Both men are classically trained but shun French products, instead eagerly direct their attention to the locality around them, concerned about food waste (Brett makes compost from his kitchen waste, which punters can take home, which I have on a few occasions for our garden) and both are especially gifted in identifying value in otherwise unloved ingredients or cuts by transforming them into something unexpectedly special.

Meanwhile Kawate san makes a luscious cold shabu-shabu from the loin of cows which have given birth to calves – meat that would never grace the menu of fine Japanese steak houses which -amongst other things- demand virgin cows.

As I mentioned earlier, Taiwan is bursting at the seams with quality produce that is only beginning to get the global coverage it deserves.

As usual, Tony Beldroega was in charge of the affairs today, with the Chef himself making an appearance mid-way through lunch to greet punters.

The food here is fine in its eating, while the dishes are beautiful to look at, the kitchen spends the majority cooking rather than plating little things perfectly. Some people do not like it for this very reason, but I love L’Arpege because at the heart of it all, the restaurant is about pure cooking, slow grilled proteins cooked grand and whole, and daring la minute preparations for everything else. It might seem counter intuitive to say this, but in today’s world of foraged, water bath modernism, L’Arpege is in the minority when it comes to actually delivering hot food on piping hot plates.

The peaty weight of this whisky matched the robust flavor of the Angus cap, and although the steak worked well with the beefy Scotch, the chimichurri sauce tasted just slightly off when washed down with whisky. When we visit again, we’ll get the Angus beef cap with our Ardbeg but take a pass on this tangy green South American sauce, which we’ve had before and liked a lot, but which is not a friendly pairing with Scotch.

And there I was bowled over. To describe generally, Endo’s sushi is all about balance. The sushi opens bright, finishes clean, umami peaks just as the textures dissipate into soft luxuriousness.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2019/11/26/endo-at-the-rotunda-lunch-menu/|A banging meal all round. The charismatic Chef thoroughly deserves the limelight, his sensationally choreographed menu, a wonderful performance taking place across his lavish Hinoki counter top.

The dinner menu is far from cheap, weighing in at £185. It’s a ton of cash, but there is enough luxury products to justify it. Otoh, his lunch omakase, priced at £60 (+ ALC topups) offers great value. I’ve been there 4 times now, and I recommend you to start with the lunch. The menu is shorter, but all the major sushi pieces make an appearance (including the chutoro and the salmon), so you won’t feel like you missed out. If you do, you can still ALC a few extras pieces anyway. Make this your next destination.

Probably not, as I feel that Pele is still tweaking his ideas about Cantonese flavours in his cuisine. Also, a couple of docked points for presenting tourists with a sub-standard white truffle that is at the moment (mid Nov 2019) showing very well near its peak season. However as it stands, his cuisine is very attractive, the cuisson is generally spot-on and I would love to revisit to see how he is progressing in due time.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|I am pleasantly surprised by the quality from this restaurant attached to a salvage yard. Led by chefs Jackson Boxer and Andrew Clarke, they have crafted a constantly changing menu, sensitive to seasons and unshackled from tradition. Priced incredibly well, all the while delivering tasty food inside an interesting decor of mostly reconditioned trinkets. I have visited 5 times in the last quarter, each meal something different and each bite a delight, like the above pairing of texturally exciting chopped bavette with a puree from blitzed mussels.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|I love Paris for gastronomy and bistronomy and in 2016, I think they (still) do it better than we do in London, on both sides of the bank. Of the ones that stood out for me was without question Hideki Nishi’s Summer Snow. The ex-Taillevent Chef works with the best of French produce, applying precision classic technique with just the right dose of Japanese heritage. Like this beautiful pork loin, grilled on the bone over Japanese bincho coals. SO delicious. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nishi san gets promoted by the Bib sometime in the near future. For me, it is a restaurant I must include on every trip to Paris.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|One of my all time favourites in The Smoke. David O’Connor and Joe Mercer-Nairn’s restaurant turned 5 this year, and is as strong as ever. The bib may have forsaken them, baffling because dishes like above stand head and shoulders above some starred restaurants in town. Although the lack of a star is probably a blessing in disguise. Five years on, it is still the best money (£35 for 3) you can spend anywhere for a decent lunch in London. If you have never been, now is the time to make it happen.

First, as roasted tail to a perfect mi-cuit and secondly with its knuckles folded into a ravioli. Both with full-flavoured bisques, each distinctly spiced from the other. I visited twice, the first was a Bretagne blue, the second a Cornish blue. Both times were fantastic. A little more than the lo-key brasserie image I think. The Chef is one Rapheal Grima, from the two meals I ate here, this guy looks serious about making Les110 a splash in London. At these prices and for this sort of execution, I’ll gladly eat live native lobsters in its own stock all day long. Two more please.
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|Even more fun than it looks. Tucked away in a North West London pub is the talented Jesse Dunford Wood and whilst his standard menu at the pub is more than decent, it is his Chef’s table that’s special. For £70pp, Jesse will feed you, and feed you, tell you some stories, display his sabrage skills and finish the show with a nod/wink to that other guy who also worked for Charlie Trotter, or a dessert bar in Hong Kong depending on where you read it first.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/best-of-2016/|My favourite new restaurant in 2015 is now my firm favourite in London. I think I’m on my 14th visit and each meal better than the last. Intensely seasonal produce is the point, with the Chef intervening to deliver maximum natural flavour. It takes quite some skill to do simplicity and in Chef Tom Kemble and sous Theo Clench, we have a cuisine that excels in the classy, subtle and delicate.

restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|When people ask me what piece of kit I have in my kitchen that I love and would recommend, there are a few contenders. Firstly, every home cook just needs to start with a good knife, a wooden spoon, a chopping board and a heavy pan. Beyond this, I rely heavily on my mixer, food processor and my pressure cooker.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|I use Chinese salted fermented black beans which are a cupboard essential for me. You can get these in any Chinese food store, usually in small plastic bags or a yellow cardboard tub. Fermented foods are a way of borrowing time from before and adding fast flavour. How lovely is that? I soaked the beans briefly and then simply blitzed all of the ingredients together, then cooked it for 10 minutes. Done!

It is luscious and rich and is used to great effect in many food cultures, notably Japanese cuisine. In Japan cod and pollock roe are cured with chilli and called mentaiko.

It is entirely possible and people are of course very accommodating. On an island of farmers and in a food culture devoted to all things butter milk and cream, it has felt in recent years like I have been missing a lot.
restaurants|20191207|EN|eatlikeagirl.com|http://eatlikeagirl.com/|Cork has a rich dairy history. It was once home to the most important butter market in the UK and Ireland. Launched in 1730, at its peak in the 1880s it was handling 500,000 casks of butter per year valued at £1.5million. People travelled from all over the world to Cork to trade butter. It is for this reason that there are recipes like Spiced Beef in Cork as the spices were traded for butter. It closed later as European butter markets competed, and in the area where it once thrived there is now Cork Butter Museum. A curious small place packed with butter paraphernalia and history including an ancient barrel of bog butter. Butter was our primary source of fat and therefore stored energy for the lean months of winter. We are still obsessed.

The cuisson is spot on, all the gelatinous bits sliding off the bone, and given the rich natural flavours, the spices do amazing things to temper it.

Inspired by his Missouri upbringing—which is also where Mark Twain hailed—Graham puts his own spin on dishes like surf and turf, the Wedge salad and Pigs in a Blanquette. For the former, he finesses it with home-style meatloaf, barbecue unagi and nori-crusted onion rings. Desserts are homey as well, from hand-cranked, seasonal ice cream paired with sheet cake to gooey butter cake topped with seasonal fruit like rosemary roasted peaches.

The frills-free, Southern-inspired eatery in Humboldt Park is still among the best destinations for chicken in any form in Chicago. The rotisserie chicken is a popular go-to, but don’t shy away from the fried birds either, especially the dark meat portions. If you’re really feeling hungry, order the 1/2 chicken with two sides, with savorous options like corn pudding, fried okra, succotash, potato salad and mac & cheese.

In addition to the heartwarming ambience, that notion is evident in the menu offerings too. As the name suggests, chicken is king here, and the kitchen has a particular penchant for frying. Nuggets, sandwiches and buttermilk battered chicken and waffles are all on hand, offering different takes on the staple.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.diningchicago.com|http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/|: When one of the most acclaimed restaurants in the world opens a restaurant with fried chicken as a star attraction, it’s safe to assume that it’s going to be above-average chicken, to say the least. The folks behind Alinea put fried chicken in a whole new spotlight at Roister, where the humble comfort food ascends to glorious new levels. The highly Instagrammable dish is part of a multi-step whole-chicken preparation that’s served with sunchokes and chamomile, and there’s also a more casual fried chicken sandwich that gets a punch of sunchoke hot sauce and some fragrant chamomile mayo.

Fried chicken may not be the most obvious go-to, but it fits in well at Dove’s Luncheonette, which does a top-notch job with clever Tex-Mex in Wicker Park. A nod to chicken-fried steak, a Texas staple, the chicken-fried chicken was an instant hit at the sunny restaurant, and it remains as fiendishly popular as ever. That’s thanks to the comforting combo of buttermilk fried chicken and creamy, spicy chorizo verde gravy. The heaping plate gets a welcome dose of brightness and sweetness thanks to peas and pearl onions.

The South Loop outpost of the boil-in-a-bag seafood concept, which specializes in Cajun-style shellfish, has added weekend brunch to its popular portfolio. A slight departure from its usual eat-with-your-hands bag-centric menu, the brunch offerings span a spectrum of Southern comforts, from fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese to snow crab cake Benedict, biscuits and gravy, shrimp and grits and chicken and waffles. Of course those seafood boils will still be available as an option, filled with customizable provisions like sausage, crab and shrimp. Cheesy grits, honey butter cornbread and garlic beignets are available as sides. For something sweet, opt for the deep-fried Oreos, and wash it all down with a mimosa, Bloody Mary or a quenching highball. Brunch is served Saturdays and Sundays from noon until 3:00 p.m.

I note that they do Latour BTG, on this visit, 2004 at £185 for 125ml. This translates to a bottle price of £1110, which would be at least the 3x mark-up (to be optimistic). Bottom line is one thing, but value for money (compared to market price) is another, but I think this is a little too much for a relatively young Latour and especially considering the private club in the hotel is organised around the first growth, I expect more of a deal. For that money, at least a 2000 perhaps. The wine list (and the Latour discovery room) is looked after by somm Jan Konetzki, who has joined from Gordon Ramsay RHR.

restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2010/03/05/my-experience-with-taiwanese-cuisine/comment-page-1/|Hello folks, I am officially back from my month long vacation, trust you have applied yourselves positively while I’ve been away. My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year. I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff. Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold. Bling. I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent. I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money. I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine. It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours. Something as common as say pizza for example – I can’t say I’ve actually tried a Neapolitan recipe passed down from the ages. This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against. And so Kang’s quest to catch a glimpse into the world of Taiwanese cuisine was born. Here are his notes (So weird writing in the third person).
restaurants|20191207|EN|londoneater.com|http://londoneater.com/2010/03/05/my-experience-with-taiwanese-cuisine/comment-page-1/|The scene is Taipei. The capital of the island republic, it is situated on the Northern tip of the country and its name unsurprisingly translates to ‘Northern Taiwan’. Home to 2.6 million, it is an emerging ultra modern metropolis of Blade Runner style concrete jungle and it’s skyline proudly accomodates Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world. Like all cities, there are shades of vintage buildings still lingering underneath all the shiny metal and glass. Old shop houses prop up the neon signs, lighting up the city’s night like a Christmas tree. It’s wonderfully urban, tight street corners just wide enough for cars to pass through and temperamental rainclouds which make London feel like Cyprus. In the belly of the beast lies a diverse range of restaurant, cafés and their famed night markets which play host to hundreds of independent street food vendors making it a sort of foodie’s wet dream. In fact, there is so much diversity in it’s food, a week is simply not enough time to try everything. But I tried anyway. My excursion wouldn’t be as impactful if not for my extended family taking me around the city, so I have the C and C’s to thank for all the recs.

The brew is light and carries a chrysanthemum sweetness about it – very easy drinking stuff. We started with a selection of ‘small dishes’ to share dishes and to start – something which is characteristic of a Taiwanese meal – including Kousiu (Saliva) chicken , Quaiwei (weird taste) vermicelli, Dou gan zhe (bean curd slices) and Mala tripe. As it was a Szechuan restaurant, everything was red in colour, evident of potent sliced chilli everywhere and the tranquilising effect of Szechuan pepper slowly started to grab hold of my tastebuds. Terrifying.

The town is a scenic getaway from the high tech city of Taipei. Here, people rolled around in vespas and flip flops and beyond the bridges, you can watch fishermen barbecueing their triumphs by the beach. Restaurants lined the coast, and as we went on a Sunday, it was as if all of Taipei had descended upon this area. We had trekked all the way here to visit the Black Shop, and to sample the locally celebrated pork chop rice.

Like all umami infused food – this bowl of rice smelled hearty, rustic and fragrant. Served piping hot, the large flap of chop garnished with bean braised tofu and pickled cabbage that carried a vinegary stink. The rice was glutinous, almost sushi rice (but I daren’t claim it) and the savoury flouriness of the pork chop was unmistakable. There was a thin outer which encapsulated the piece of meat, eggs must have been used and the coating absorbed alot of moisture leading to a juiciness which softened the texture of the pork. The combination of the bean-flavoured tofu, the vinegary pickled cabbage and the soya infused egginess of the porkchop gave way to an exemplary example of umami… I finished two bowls.

You come out of the MRT station Dingxi (MRT Orange Line) , I think it’s exit number 1, up the escalator, its on the left hand side and you will see the place ‘through the window’ as you are going up the escalator…. more confusing that it sounds, but trust me it should make more sense when you guys get there, basically it’s in a separate building just outside the station 🙂 Ahh… when you are in DingXi make sure try THE original soya milk shop called ‘Dou Jiang Da Wang’. The directions… are difficult to describe, but it’s a five minute walk from the station (Dingxi) and any local in the area should know this place, very popular… ok good luck and hope you enjoy it!!!

You get a flour pancake (almost like a flour tortilla, but a bit tougher – hot off the griddle), and it’s filled with a little rice, veg, egg, chinese sausage – whatever you like, really.  The best part, in my opinion, was always the crushed peanuts/peanut powder to add crunch and sweet nuttiness.  It’s great stuff and I’d recommend looking out for it next time you’re in Tapiei.

Spontaneity and creativity reign supreme, Passard and his kitchen still immensely spirited in their practice of gastronomy at the highest levels, they continue to introduce new dishes to their menu, not bad for a restaurant now in its 33rd year. As usual, Tony Beldroega was in charge of the affairs today, with the Chef himself making an appearance mid-way through lunch to greet punters. I had wanted to try Alain’s latest Frankenstein creation, the Chimera, pigeon stiched together with a rack of lamb, but alas it wasn’t on the menu on this visit.

The food here is fine in its eating, while the dishes are beautiful to look at, the kitchen spends the majority cooking rather than plating little things perfectly. Some people do not like it for this very reason, but I love L’Arpege because at the heart of it all, the restaurant is about pure cooking, slow grilled proteins cooked grand and whole, and daring la minute preparations for everything else. It might seem counter intuitive to say this, but in today’s world of foraged, water bath modernism, L’Arpege is in the minority when it comes to actually delivering hot food on piping hot plates. A pre-requisite as it always should be for any fine food that is cooked with love and respect!

Bottom line is one thing, but value for money (compared to market price) is another, but I think this is a little too much for a relatively young Latour and especially considering the private club in the hotel is organised around the first growth, I expect more of a deal. For that money, at least a 2000 perhaps. The wine list (and the Latour discovery room) is looked after by somm Jan Konetzki, who has joined from Gordon Ramsay RHR.

My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year. I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff. Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold. Bling. I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent. I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money. I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine. It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours.

This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against.

The capital of the island republic, it is situated on the Northern tip of the country and its name unsurprisingly translates to ‘Northern Taiwan’. Home to 2.6 million, it is an emerging ultra modern metropolis of Blade Runner style concrete jungle and it’s skyline proudly accomodates Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world. Like all cities, there are shades of vintage buildings still lingering underneath all the shiny metal and glass. Old shop houses prop up the neon signs, lighting up the city’s night like a Christmas tree. It’s wonderfully urban, tight street corners just wide enough for cars to pass through and temperamental rainclouds which make London feel like Cyprus. In the belly of the beast lies a diverse range of restaurant, cafés and their famed night markets which play host to hundreds of independent street food vendors making it a sort of foodie’s wet dream. In fact, there is so much diversity in it’s food, a week is simply not enough time to try everything. But I tried anyway. My excursion wouldn’t be as impactful if not for my extended family taking me around the city, so I have the C and C’s to thank for all the recs.

Terrifying.

The way you reel off all these amazing food pictures makes it seem like its so easy to you. 8 x 10 is a nice format and only the other day I was looking at some out our pics thinking that something was off on the frame dimensions. Maybe this is my answer. And I should get a better lens. And a better flash. And maybe I should read a book. *Sigh*

My yearly visit to the folks is always enlightening if perspective bending though this is the first time in eight years that I went home in time to celebrate Chinese New Year. I’m carrying alot of holiday weight right now, five kilos to be exact, heavy stuff. Astrologists are predicting a gold rush this year and have interpreted the year of the Metal Tiger to be one made of solid gold. Bling. I had originally intended this post to be the closer to my run of unofficial Chinese New Year write-ups and was suppose to coincide with Chap Go Meh – the fifteenth day of the new Lunar year – the same day which also marks the end of the Chinese New year festival… but other more pressing commitments had ensured a five day delay – building websites still doesn’t quite pay the rent. I had spent most of the time travelling between Brunei, Singapore and Taiwan, the latter was where I decided to spend my money. I have good reason to stuff myself silly and I filled my schedule with pit-stops to restaurants which served something representatively local – like a crash course into the native cuisine. It’s all well and good that we have so many restaurants which cater to all sorts of world cuisines, but it occurred to me that London has been the first destination that I have sampled certain international flavours. Something as common as say pizza for example – I can’t say I’ve actually tried a Neapolitan recipe passed down from the ages. This holiday would double as gastronomic adventure and I view it as a way to build my CV in a particular style of cuisine, so that I’ll always have something to compare my London exploits against.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|Hidden away in Hammersmith, a newcomer seeking to evoke memories of the legendary early-’90s restaurant on the site; it was good-all-round on our early-days visit, but the standards which would once have been exceptional are now relatively commonplace.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|Hammersmith estate agents have a lot to thank this site for. Over twenty years ago, the founding of a cute little restaurant there helped to rebrand a tangle of Victorian backstreets as ‘Brackenbury Village’, and their commissions have benefitted ever since.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|The site has had its ups and downs and after a short stint in recent times as ‘The Port of Manilla’ – a magnet for Filippinos everywhere, but out-of-step with its natural local clientele – it’s been returned to its former guise by a local resident who also happens to be restaurant royalty: Ossie Gray’s mother Rose co-founded the River Café.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/29-01-2014/the-brackenbury/|Prices are reasonable but – given the decidedly ‘local’ setting – we couldn’t help wondering if it wouldn’t make sense to offer some special menus for brunch, early evening and so on. Will people from outside the ‘Village’ seek the place out? We hope so, but if you’re planning a special visit, wait for warmer weather – the large pavement terrace is a particular attraction.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|On the eastern fringe of Covent Garden, a smart basement Japanese restaurant with a rather corporate atmosphere and quite high prices (especially on the wine front); for business entertainment, though, it has its attractions, and the lunch menu is a value-proposition well worth seeking out.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|It rather seems, then, that this is a restaurant which is not – yet – accustomed to much lunchtime walk-in business. That’s a shame, as the lunch menu here is well worth seeking out. We went for the Bento Lunch (£17.50), which – in the range and quality of the dishes – is one of the most ambitious we can recall (excluding the ridiculous Hakkasan-group newcomer Crystan, of course, but that’s another story altogether). The box comprised a range of sushi, and of sashimi, and some cooked fish, as well as a very tasty chicken pancake-sandwich and a bowl of miso soup. If that doesn’t sound very filling, it wasn’t, but the attention to detail, the tastes and the textures were impressive throughout.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|Fortunately, then, the Bento box left ample space for a pudding – on the evidence of the elegantly plated assembly of salted caramel ice-cream, pancake and chestnut we enjoyed, these are well worth leaving space for. The waitress even prompted us to have a coffee – she promised, in the face of all the precedents of Japanese restaurants, that it would be good’ and our espresso was indeed surprisingly impressive.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/03-01-2013/wabi-wc2/|That coffee was, however, also £3, hinting at one key reservation about this place which is that, Ã  la carte, the prices seem rather high. In fact, drinking water here – tap was willingly brought – seems a good idea all-round, as even quite modest clarets, for example, quickly whizz past the £50 mark. The other major drawback is that, though the setting is comfortable enough, the rather rectilinear layout of this decidedly rectangular basement makes for a setting whose atmosphere tips inescapably towards the corporate.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/suda-wc2/|Being the only bearer of the brand so far, Suda, of course, is not yet a chain. We assume, however, that this offshoot of the S&P group is a a prototype for a new ‘diffusion’ multiple to be situated mainly, perhaps exclusively, in upmarket shopping malls – it has that pleasant-enough-but-somehow-no-real-character feeling which seems to be aim of all those who design eating places in or near shopping centres.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/suda-wc2/|Service was unfailingly pleasant, though, and the setting is spacious and comfortable – there are still many much worse places in which you could find yourself, even in this fast-improving part of town.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|We all know restaurant groups have DNA – resemblances between the members of the ‘family’ explicable by their common origins. A pretty good example is the ‘Nigel Platts-Martin group’.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|If you live outside restaurant-land, you may never have heard of this former City solicitor, but he’s just pulled off the remarkable double of being a major stakeholder not only in Chez Bruce (perennially London’s Favourite Restaurant, as determined by Harden’s reporters), but also in the restaurant newly-crowned as the one where you get London’s best food, The Ledbury.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|On the evidence of Medlar, it seems that restaurant DNA can be acquired – unlike the real sort – simply by propinquity and experience. How else to explain that the new Chelsea restaurant feels, for all practical purposes, just as if Mr Platts-Martin had a share in it? (He definitely doesn’t.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|That’s the bad news. The good news is that all the other bits of the DNA have come too, so the menu is full of nice food with a gentle twist, so that you feel you want to eat all the way through it. When the dishes come, you’re not disappointed by the results. And the service, by and large, manages to be there when you want it, and mercifully absent when you don’t. And a very good wine list too.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|In short, you might say, Medlar has many of the qualities you might associate with the legendary ‘perfect neighbourhood restaurant’.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|Which begs a very interesting question. When was the last time Chelsea had a real reputation as a good mid-market restaurant neighbourhood? If anything, the King’s Road has a bit of a name as the-street-with-no-restaurants. It wasn’t always so, of course. Not that we were there, you understand, but wasn’t there quite a scene there in the ’60s? That momentum carried on into the ’80s (when we do sort of remember it).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/07-10-2011/medlar-sw10/|By the ’90s, however, the spotlight had begin to move ‘Up West’, and – with the odd exception in the environs of Sloane Square – not much has been heard from Chelsea ever since.

The situation has improved a bit in recent years, with the arrival in the immediate area of Chancery, and also the very wine-led basement bar and restaurant 28-50.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|This essentially English setting has now seen a very Gallic incursion. A restaurant once known by the suitably stolid name of Hodgson’s has now been taken over by the Club Gascon folk, and given a very French name indeed. Cigalon strikes us as an odd choice, though, echoing as it does that of a Marcel Pagnol movie whose eponymous hero was a ProvenÃ§al chef whose restaurant remained defiantly empty. Perhaps the French have a sense of humour after all?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/10-11-2010/le-cigalon-wc2/|The food is not bad, but – like the décor – we couldn’t help wondering if it is ‘right’. The bread, a selection, was OK, if not at all remarkable, but the overwhelming impression of a bowl of ProvenÃ§al vegetable soup was that it was rather a lady’s portion. Our guest’s small portion of marinated sardines similarly failed to cause much excitement.

Puddings included a pleasant (if rather could-do-this-at-home) mélange of citrus fruits and sponge, and a very delicate chocolate tart, somewhat peculiarly presented on a slate platter with what looked like a small deboned fish, but which turned out to be a fancy smear of curd. Our guest pronounced it a moderate success, which was also his view of the coffee.

Unless hanging out with the rich is regarded as an end it itself, this is rather unsatisfying. You’re paying ‘destination’ prices, yet there’s no feeling that you actually arrived anywhere.

Indeed, a starter of peaches and lobster presented on a glass plate was one of the most unexpectedly beautiful and delicious dishes – utterly satisfying in its simplicity of both presentation and taste – that we’ve had for a very long time. The two pasta dishes which we’d ordered (did we mention we felt poor?) were also very commendable. Pasta is often satisfying but rarely interesting – these dishes were both.

Tasty tomato bread, for example, made a good complement for a fresh-tasting assemblage of peas, beans and Feta-type cheese, and the brace of mini cheeseburgers were very decent too. Star of the show, though, was the tuna tataki – a nicely balanced small (but quite generous) plate and, in accordance with the fashion du jour, attractively florally enhanced.

How else to explain why we found the latest addition to the Marco Pierre White empire to be both thoroughly competent and completely pointless?
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-10-2007/marco-sw6/|But, first, let’s do the ‘competent’ bit: the cooking is generally very good. Highlights of a lunch included an unctuous crab bisque, a light and delicious kipper pÃ¢té, a beautiful and generous piece of cod and some splendid rib-eye steak. Marco’s signature lemon tart was also well up to standard. Further to accentuate the positive, the restaurant is handsome and solidly furnished – with that slightly sub-nightclub level of glitz the French often do well – and service is friendly and tries hard.

If there is one here, however, it passed us by. It’s almost as if Marco hasn’t noticed that a lot’s happened in the restaurant world since he built up most of his empire in the ’90s.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-10-2007/marco-sw6/|So perhaps Marco’s got one eye to the locals? Well, the set lunch menu is exceptional value (2 courses for £16.50), but weekday business is thin out West (even in Chelsea proper). The weekend could perhaps be a opportunity, but the affluent folk who live round here often have kids. The carte, however, is mainly not child-suitable – oddly, as the place is named after one of his children – and no thought has been given to a kids’ menu or portions.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|Under unchanged ownership, but new management, the Shoreditch premises once known as Beard-to-Tail still look rather as they did when we reviewed that informal bar-restaurant a year ago, not especially kindly. (Occasionally, we get things right!)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|Some of the important things, though, already seem to be going very much in the right direction: this struck us as a very handy sort of informal all-day restaurant even if it still does have a bit of work to do to impress the locals. We lunched pretty much alone. The welcome is warm, and the food - if not especially ambitious - was in a different league from our former visit.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|From the daytime menu - essentially a cut-down selection from the evening offering - we were able to try most of the types of dishes on offer. Tasty tomato bread, for example, made a good complement for a fresh-tasting assemblage of peas, beans and Feta-type cheese, and the brace of mini cheeseburgers were very decent too. Star of the show, though, was the tuna tataki - a nicely balanced small (but quite generous) plate and, in accordance with the fashion du jour, attractively florally enhanced.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/ec2/penkul-and-banks.htm|The drinks selection was inviting, and quite reasonably priced too. For lunch, a pint of Brooklyn - what else, round here? - made a very good accompaniment.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-11-2006/found-ec2/|This new restaurant and private member’s bar has been likened to “a gothic Claridges”. But aside from a quirky line in animal skulls (which make up a chandelier, wall lights, and just sit around on the bar), its airy décor fits firmly into the vaguely Manhattanite style that’s so familiar in the area. With its dark wood floors, steel pillars, and chocolate brown just about everything else, it’s classic Shoreditch.

With his flowing locks, he looked a bit like a survivor from an early ’80s heavy metal band and added some much-needed raffish charm to what at lunch is still a pretty dead scene. At night-time, he told me, things are becoming much more happening (and on cue as he said this, someone poked their head round the door to nab a table for twelve at 9pm).

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|If a success, this 400-seat Mayfair newcomer could quite possibly end up biggest-grossing restaurant in London. Comprising large dining rooms both Italian and Asian and an enormous basement bar, it’s roughly a third bigger than the D&D (‘Conran’) group’s Quaglino’s or Ramsay’s Bread Street, which are as big as quality London restaurants currently get.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|The Conran comparison is particularly apposite, as Arkady Novikov is the Sir Terence Conran of Moscow, just much bigger. Claiming 50 restaurants in the Russian capital, his empire is at least twice the size of D&D’s. That’s the sort of success that buys you toys such as Gianni Versace’s former house on Lake Como, as well as a handy townhouse in Knightsbridge.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|The new restaurant occupies a site where others have tried and failed, so the obvious question is: is Mayfair going to be Mr Novikov’s Waterloo? Initial impressions are indeed that the Italian restaurant feels like a bit of a ballroom – how is that going to work in a city where upmarket Italians are invariably on an intimate scale? The panelled basement bar, however, is a great space, which we suspect will become a popular rendezvous; let’s hope it doesn’t end up ALL Russians and their striking nieces.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|But our mission that day was to check out the on-your-way-in Asian restaurant. With its unadorned dark wood tables, and the glazed-in kitchen visible in the distance, it has a somewhat Identikit quality about it – not unpleasant, but not a particular attraction in its own right either. Pretty much ideal, then, for the sort of informal business lunching which had already drawn quite a good crowd by the time of our early-days visit.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-12-2011/novikov-w1/|The real surprise, however, was the food – which was, with one exception, consistently impressive. The quality comes as more a shock, because a pan-Asian menu – by definition – lacks any sort of coherency. From a reviewing point of view, that makes it curiously easy, as you just have to order one of everything – sushi, skewers, dim sum, barbecue. All of the above were just very good, with the surprise highlight being a dish of truffled duck. The only dish that didn’t quite live up to its price tag (£45!) was some tempura lobster – not bad, just not really worth the expense. Otherwise, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. For Mayfair.

Nothing was unpleasant, but many dishes had a slight feeling of something missing. Bread was unremarkable. Starters of soups and antipasti didn’t quite make the grade.  A risotto wasn’t quite right, and a dish of lamb and roast potatoes lacked taste. Towards the end, however, things picked up. A foodie guest raved about the ice cream, and the chocolate tart with it really did melt (in the very best way), and the espresso was excellent.

Both offer essentially the same fixed menu – salad, steak ‘n’ chips – and both make a big deal of their respective secret sauces. The first to open (Relais de Venise) was praised in this column, but has subsequently been slated by most other critics. If popularity is anything to go by, however, the punters are with us.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-12-2005/entrecote-caf-de-paris-w1/|Part of de Venise’s success is no doubt due to the fact that it is an authentic – and so far one-off – replica of the Parisian original, and comes complete with a good dose of joie de vivre. This newcomer, however – an offshoot of an outfit from Geneva, and with outlets in Lisbon and Dubai – just seems like an authentic replica of uninspired restaurants everywhere. If they didn’t just inherit the interior here, the person who designed it – in a style 20 years out of date – should be shot.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-12-2005/entrecote-caf-de-paris-w1/|The food does little to raise the spirits. The salad – marginally better than at de Venise – lost its advantage by being served up with dull bread. Steak/frites were a pretty much total disappointment. It does not help that your dinner plate arrives with the chips already on board – a school-diners style of service that has no place in even the humblest bistro. That special sauce – which had separated – seemed to add little to a pretty pallid bit of beef. If you try this place, we’d certainly recommend a good dose of Dijon to spice it up. A crème brûlée was pleasant enough, but we left our coffee undrunk.

Your critic’s meal kicked off with a well-made bloody Mary, followed by a satisfying plate of risotto liberally garnished with lobster and king prawn, and a bite of light cheesecake. Companion had spaghetti al vongole which inspired much praise,as did the cheesecake. Bread and coffee were pretty good too. All in all, a meal that was ‘fit for purpose’, and more.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/17-01-2007/sitaaray-wc2/|Can you hear the alarm bells ringing? Theatreland location and ‘theme’ are not generally a whiz-bang formula for quality dining. The proprietors, however, also own Chor Bizarre in Mayfair – which has long been an Indian restaurant of some note – and a real effort seems to have been made. The emphasis is on grills, at reasonable prices. Good-value lunch and pre-theatre menus (all for £14.50 or less) are a speciality, and in the evenings parties can dine from an all-in selection for £18. On our visit, seafood – in particular king prawns and salmon – made a particular impression, and a rasmalai (cheese dessert) was also a hit. Service is charming too, if sometimes a bit slow. We never really drink wine in Indian restaurants, but, if you do, the selection here has received more attention than usual.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/11-07-2007/great-queen-street-wc2/|For some reason, new-wave Old English food is something you normally only find in pubs. There is of course a famous exception – the founder of the movement, St John of Smithfield. But the vast majority of St John’s imitators and inspirees are pubs, or dining rooms attached to pubs.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/11-07-2007/great-queen-street-wc2/|The logic of this (or lack of it) may have struck the owners of this newcomer – opposite Covent Garden’s Masonic Temple – many of whom also backed the Anchor & Hope, the most prominent gastropub of recent years. It isn’t a pub at all. But this fact almost seems to have given them cold feet – so what was in former days a bar has been decked out to look like the dining room of a clapped-out boozer.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/11-07-2007/great-queen-street-wc2/|The great thing about GQS, as opposed to the A&H,is that you can book. The less good thing is that the food is less good. The manifest aim – as is evident the second you look at the A4 Xeroxed menu – is simplicity. Amen to that. Our choice ran crab on toast, beetroot salad, grilled plaice, cherry cake and crème caramel. But with simplicity, you do risk raising the issue: ‘could I make it at home’. And while the answer wasn’t in any case a yes, the skill in evidence by no means made the question absurd. There was none of the sense of genius-at-work in the kitchen that’s made the A&H such a mad success.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/11-07-2007/great-queen-street-wc2/|But let’s be positive. Prices are modest enough to defuse any serious criticism of the place. And service is very personable. The gastropub revolution has yet to infiltrate the West End properly, and this faux-boozer represents a very respectable start.

Wandsworth-baked bread, brought immediately, was fine – white, chewy and, in a good way, very English. But who in their right mind would serve olive oil with bread like that? It made no sense. Neither, really, did Chesham goat’s cheese nettles  pirogi, which tasted as unappetising as they looked; a few greasy breadcrumbs on top did not help. A Canvey Dover sole was plated up complete with head, skin and roe. The flesh had admittedly been grilled to perfection, but the accompanying spinach verged on inedible. A baked cheesecake was a great wodge of a thing, with a claggy base, and accompanied by an ungainly dollop of rhubarb jam. After this multiple assault, only a strong post-prandial filter coffee stopped me feeling slightly queasy.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/26-11-2007/gazette-sw11/|When you see menu of this notably unpretentious all-day joint, which opened up near the Battersea riverside early in 2007, you may feel that you have stumbled into some sort of Francophile heaven. This double-page job – printed up freshly every day – offers dishes ranging from pancakes and croques-messieurs to quite ambitious plats du jour – perfect, it seems, for everything from lunch with the kids to an informal romantic dinner (if you avoid the football evenings, that is). There is an excellent range of French wines (and other drinks) too, all at reasonable prices.

Bread set a upbeat note, and a reasonably-priced kids’ pasta special was also good, but there were just too many duds. That’s not to say that there’s any want of generosity – if anything, portions are too big – but a seafood chowder was impossibly salty, and both a venison plat du jour and a floating island would have benefited from being half the size and twice as subtle. Coffee was also indifferent.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/08-05-2013/ottos-wc1/|The idea that a restaurant is an extension of the personality, even the home, of its proprietor is common in France. Witness the number of restaurants called ‘Chez’ quelqu’un. But you see it surprisingly rarely here. In London, the aim of mid-market restaurants often seems to be de-personalised good taste, rather than any expression of character, or still less of personality.

We also noticed that the interior, in a light and airy period room in Bloomsbury, is decked out with that quirky, slightly domestic, taste that the French often apply to restaurants, but which an Englishman would somehow find embarrassing.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/16-04-2011/11-park-walk-sw10/|Honey, we forgot the food! Are we imagining it, or is there a bit of a spate of restaurant at the moment which are very nice in every way’ except that the food is entirely unremarkable? The new Italian restaurant on the Chelsea site that was formerly called Aubergine (same ownership), would appear to be a classic example.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/16-04-2011/11-park-walk-sw10/|Concerns that the food might not live up, however, started right at the beginning. We have a theory – doubtless we’ve shared it with you before if you read our reviews with any regularity – that you can usually tell everything you need to know about a restaurant from its bread. This was a classic example – the basket of brown and white breads which arrived was undistinguished in both taste and texture, and owed nothing obvious to Italy.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/16-04-2011/11-park-walk-sw10/|The meal which followed was not bad, but it was, pretty much all of a piece with the bread – not bad or unpleasant, but safe, standard and somewhat uninspired. The best dish was a pannacotta that was almost too generous. But it was too late by then. The feeling that this is a restaurant where they’d forgotten about the food was, by that point, inescapable.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2008/searcys-ec2/|First problem, however, was that we couldn’t actually see any obvious physical changes. We were therefore very grateful to our helpful and engaging waiter for pointing out that the carpet had changed colour, and that there was now a new dining bar where solo diners can eat watching the goings-on by the lake. For a place that had just been ‘relaunched’, though, we’d have to say the overall impression was one of continuity (and, let’s be frank, just a little bit dreary – these ’70s spaces take quite a lot of livening up). It didn’t help that the place, admittedly in the first week of its new guise, was pretty much empty for lunch.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-10-2008/searcys-ec2/|The result of all this Englishness, can, in short, be a menu which lacks ‘easy’ appeal: there was nothing on the menu that our (professional-diner) lunching companion really wanted. That’s not to denigrate the aim, which is a worthy one, but we suspect that this whole English thing – it its extreme form – may be a bit of a fad, and that we’ll shortly all go back to the sort of Anglo-French stuff that’s done quite nicely for the last century or so (if, perhaps, with more English dishes, and a bit more emphasis on local provenance). That’s not to criticise the realisation or presentation of the food  we tried, though, which was thoroughly good, if not, of itself, a sufficient reason to seek the place out.

We do see getting the punters in as a bit of an issue here, and we do wonder if the absence of a keenly-priced set lunch and pre-theatre menu isn’t just a little bit barmy. This is quite a big restaurant, and – particularly with its slightly ‘acquired-taste’ menu – it’s difficult to see how they’re really going to build the custom up any other way.

He’s no slouch as a restaurateur either, and has brought a trendy vibe to establishments such as Cecconi’s in Mayfair. Even he, though, was defeated by Balham. Well, no, that’s not really true. Having been part of the early-wave operators that made Balham the bijou destination it is today, he decided last year that the sarf London suburb establishment no longer really fitted with his NyLon portfolio. The solution was to job the place on to Sam Harrison. The latter is, of course, the Sam of eponymous Chiswick brasserie fame, and he’s now put the other half of his name over the door in Balham.

A Saturday brunchtime visit found quite a buzzy place (not attracting a particularly beautiful crowd, it would have to be said) with pleasant (but sometimes slow) service and food which was very much a supporting attraction.

My meal – ballotine with brioche, then polenta with raclette and finally a chocolate mousse – blew a bit hot and cold, but was never less than competent.

The result is an establishment which doesn’t feel at all institutional. It may be symbolic that, though you enter through the gallery entrance, the restaurant overlooks a busy (and not especially attractive) streetscape, which tends to suggest that this is a ‘real’ restaurant that just happens to be attached to an art gallery. (Perhaps this really is the “ace cafe with a museum attached” of which the V&A once famously boasted.)

It’s also the name of this bar by Southwark Bridge, which is of note as the only non-chain outlet in a string of places to have opened over the last couple of years around Shakespeare’s Globe.

While the former was a lavish full-colour production full of sexily-named enticements to kill off the rest of the day, the latter was a tatty photocopied sheet, with a selection – notwithstanding the odd nod to Africa – almost exclusively composed of standard bar and grazing fodder. A thirst-quencher arrived in the form of one of their fresh-fruit blends, which delivered a refreshing kick. The wine list being practically non-existent I opted for one of the two beers – a Finnish Lapin Kulta – whose distinguishing feature seemed to be a total lack of taste.

That said, it was tasty enough. Perfectly OK fishcakes and chips, for example, suggest that the food – if not the main thing – “does the job”, and in generous portions to boot.

We visited a first few after opening, when a limited menu was still being offered, but prices were already pretty much in line with Westminster. In the short term, that’s a bit of a cheek – if you’re not sorted out to the extent you’re offering a full menu, don’t charge full prices. Even when they are fully up and running though – by now, presumably – prices struck as as being too high to gather much of a following during a deepening recession.

You’ve pumped out a cookbook a year in recent times, and write a newspaper column. You’ve become something of a hero of the English culinary renaissance. And you finally decide it’s time to go it alone. The moment has come to launch an establishment with your own name above the door.

The highlight for us (lunching in the singular) was a delicious pile of green tapenade on a piece of toasted bread, but arancini (rice balls) also satisfied. To follow, fegato alla Veneziana, a small but very adequate dish for around £6, was well complemented by a plate of zucchini dressed with olive oil. Add a plate of roast autumn fruits (the best dish, dressed with a sprinkle of crumble), and you’ve still, with modest wine, had a very pleasant lunch for £25. Which may be another reason the place is already humming.

What, apart from architecture, is the meaningful distinction between the two?)

Huge picture windows give the ground floor (there’s also a basement) a fine view of the canal, while the very airy interior is a stylish medley of slate, dark-stained timber, and green velvet drapes. If I hadn’t known that it was the creation of a Russian restaurant group, I would have thought that it was a third opening by Rainer Becker of Roka and Zuma fame.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-12-2005/yakitoria-w2/|The fashionable Japanese menu is reminiscent of Roka’s with its emphasis on skewers from the charcoal robata grill, alongside a wide selection of sushi and main dishes. I went for a catholic selection incorporating five kinds of skewer and some trendy sounding ‘spicey red-eye’ and ‘garden’ sushi — the former spiked with chilli pepper, the latter using ingredients like burdock. None of the items were disappointing, but equally all fell short of being inspirational.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/22-12-2005/yakitoria-w2/|Service was charming but a little keystone kops-ish (or whatever it is that Russians say for being disorganised and amateurish).

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-07-2013/hutong-se1/|On the 33rd floor of the Shard, an ambitious Chinese restaurant that was still giving a slight impression of settling in on our visit; we had an enjoyable lunch, though, and prices are not unreasonable, considering.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-07-2013/hutong-se1/|It used to be easy. High-rise restaurants in London were few, small and expensive, and everyone knew they were primarily there to rip off tourists, birthday celebrants and romantics. Yet, as London reaches for the stars, such restaurants have suddenly become so numerous as to seem almost unremarkable. Take the lift to the 33rd floor of the Shard, for example, and you find a complex comprising not one but two Aqua-group restaurants (Aqua Shard, British in style, as well as Hutong), and also a brasserie-style operation (Oblix) run by Rainer Becker of Zuma fame – the bars and dining rooms can accommodate hundreds of guests in total. (And that’s before a Shangri-La hotel opens in the same building at the end of the year.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-07-2013/hutong-se1/|The landlords must have been cutting good deals, because space is used at these new establishments in a lavish way which those of us used to the West End’s cosy ways can find it difficult to adjust to. Indeed, these vast air-conditioned expanses often just feel rather dead. And how can the actual dining rooms compete with the views, anyway? On our daytime visit, none of the Shard restaurant interiors filled us with any great excitement. Of the three, however, we suspect that the dark and dimly-lit interior of Hutong – the swankiest of the establishments – is the one that would work best by night. By day, leaving the view out of the reckoning, we felt as if we were lunching in one of the more upmarket of Mr Disney’s resort-hotel dining rooms (and not an especially comfortable one either).
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/09-07-2013/hutong-se1/|The dim sum menu – not especially helpfully divided up, in the way you’d find in Chinatown – seemed a good place to try a range of tastes, but the affable waiter steered us to the pre-chosen steamed selection from the main menu. These came prettily colour coded, not something we can really recall before, but the differences of hue among the selection was more pronounced than the differences of taste – in every other way they hit the spot, though, and they certainly delivered quite a chilli kick.

As good a word as youre going to find to describe the bright and effortfully informal mismatched décor of this large, light and airy Pimlico bar/restaurant, on the site long known as the Ebury.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/sw1/no-11-pimlico-road.htm|The same adjective could also be applied to the cuisine. This is, they say, intended to be a female-friendly sort of establishment, and the menu is long on snack-style dishes, including salads. Thats by no means to say theyre all lo-cal - our chicken schnitzel and chips was very good on both counts, though the portions might not satisfy a true trencherman. Bread was very good too, and came in a nice variety, even if they do charge for it. Prepare yourself for a real sugar high, but the rhubarb roulade - again, no real economiser on the calories - was a real highlight of a visit in which none of three people found anything really to fault.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-10-2007/the-only-running-footman-w1/|We stopped by a for a quick lunch in the ground floor bar (largely given over to tables). It’s had a bit of a makeover, but the most eye-catching thing about  the place – some of whose windows have false bottle-glass – is that it still feels as if it should be in a Surrey high street, rather than one of the priciest postcodes in the world. Perhaps that’s part of its charm. The crowd on the day of our visit was also less glitzy than such a location might suggest.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/12-10-2007/the-only-running-footman-w1/|The editorial ‘we’ in this case comprised just one luncher, and we just had a quick lunch of haddock ‘n’ chips, treacle tart and coffee. Perhaps we were just lucky, but it really was just the job. The chips were particularly interesting. Fat chips can be horrible, but these were exemplarily moreish in both their taste and their crispy texture. The tart also rated mention, steering that difficult middle course between being heavy handedly rustic on the one hand and too poncey on the other. Incidentals such as bread (made, for once, on the premises) and coffee were also well up to scratch.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/06-08-2008/mint-leaf-lounge-ec2/|Not an accusation you could level, by the way, at the design. Perhaps stung by the comparisons its dusky West End forebear has drawn to Hakkasan, the style here – and they’ve spent a packet on it – avoids dark hues for a light colour scheme. A large shimmering bar dominates the space, which is cleverly subdivided into a cocktail area and a main dining area, saving the room from feeling like the box it basically is. Who’d have thought a few years ago that you’d get a place like this somewhere as boring as Angel Court?

Even allowing for this, portions are outrageously dinky.

Stuffed peppers? £7!

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|Koffmann may not be a household name nowadays, but – if you take out the empire-building, self-promoting and foul-mouthed bits – he was the Gordon Ramsay of the nineties. His Tante Claire restaurant – on the site now the Ramsay HQ – was invariably London’s best. Then he moved TC to the Berkeley Hotel site which is now Pétrus, and didn’t prosper. He dropped out of sight for a while, and his return has long been rumoured.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|Amazingly, however, almost everything about the new restaurant manages to some extent to be wrong. It doesn’t help that this is a site with poor proportions, and a bit of a chequered history to boot. (To make it all the more confusing, it’s not so long ago that it was called Pétrus.) It’s been done over as a straight down-the-line Gallic brasserie which, without any patina of age, just looks a little bit cold and univiting.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/24-06-2008/brasserie-st-jacques-sw1-updated/|The service was often pleasant, but it seemed to come and go rather. And couldn’t the waiter have mentioned we were over-ordering? Our main dish came not only with the spuds and greens we had ordered, but also with some unadvertised rice and vegetables which, as it turned out, were included anyway. It added insult to injury when the unnecessary bowl of spinach came at £1 per teaspoonful.

After all, how often have each of us wished we weren’t facing a car ride or train journey home after a great meal? But ‘restaurants-with-rooms’ are more than just convenient, they are destinations. A way to get out of the city or to celebrate an occasion and, of course, to experience dining out as part of a total experience – always more difficult among the clamour of competing attractions in a city. So, this week, we bring you some of the best restaurants-with-rooms.

With such a strong lunchtime food emphasis and nowhere to stand around with a glass, ‘wine bar’ wouldn’t do. The term ‘bistro’ can sound rather dated. So the solution the owners of this Farringdon newcomer have opted for is to call it a ‘Bar and wine shop’. With its bare tables, daily-changing blackboard menu and open kitchen, however, the place looked for all the world like a ‘contemporary bistro’ on our lunchtime visit (and an instantly-popular one at that).

Dishes come twinned with interesting and reasonably-priced wine suggestions by the glass. If you want to do the thinking, the list is 200-strong, and has a sensible mark-up policy. At the bottom end, you’ll pay the standard three times retail, but, if you drink better, the proportional mark-up, never exceeding £25, falls away sharply. By night, you can stop by just for a drink – for consumption sur place, or to take away.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w1/polpo.htm|). Has anyone looked at it? This is a New York restaurant, pure and simple. Or, more specifically, a Downtown restaurant.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w1/polpo.htm|. The cicheti (Italian tapas) are very tasty, as well as remarkably economical. The highlight for us (lunching in the singular) was a delicious pile of green tapenade on a piece of toasted bread, but arancini (rice balls) also satisfied. To follow, fegato alla Veneziana, a small but very adequate dish for around £6, was well complemented by a plate of zucchini dressed with olive oil. Add a plate of roast autumn fruits (the best dish, dressed with a sprinkle of crumble), and youve still, with modest wine, had a very pleasant lunch for £25. Which may be another reason the place is already humming.

Why? Perhaps because it’s trying to be a sort of beast you don’t see very often – a quality (read pricey) Indian restaurant, attached to a serious bar operation. It’s an act that might be easier to pull off in the West End, but, even there, we can think of only one place – Mint Leaf – which answers to that description.

One is by having friendly service which- having allowed diners to enjoy a drink downstairs – efficiently shepherds them to the restaurant above. Another is banning smoking throughout.

The food is from a serious chef, Bhuwan Batt, who worked in top Indian hotels, before coming to London diners’ attention at Tabla, near Canary Wharf. The style of the dishes, and their presentation, is perhaps a bit more ‘standard’ than one might expect – hotel experience coming through, perhaps – but there are some unusual dishes, All those we tried ‘worked’, and they all came in generous quantities.

Perhaps it’s in reaction to this that the newcomer we review today takes them back to their roots. You could walk past its forbidding black double doors on a curiously nondescript patch of (Lower) Regent Street every day without realising there was a restaurant there.

With all due regard to Alain Ducasse and his somewhat bizarre recent boosterism of London as the restaurant capital of the world, the capital’s scene has been pretty dull of late.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/23-02-2010/manson-sw6/|We hope Ms Tuley will last longer in Fulham: the heaving crowd we found on a Monday night visit certainly suggested that she may have cause to stay. The attraction can’t be the interior – pleasant enough, but feeling as much like a low-lit wine bar as it does a restaurant of ambition. We suspect that the pleasant staff are not the principal attraction either.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/23-02-2010/manson-sw6/|No, it must be something to do with the food, which shows a grounding in the classics of just the type you’d hope a Ramsay protégée would possess: indeed, as soon as you taste the bread rolls (a variation on fougasse), you know this is not a Fulham wine bar of any known and usual type. (Fair to say, you’ll be reminded of this when the bill arrives too.)
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/23-02-2010/manson-sw6/|It was the dessert, though, that really caught our attention. The combination of the Jersusalem artichoke cheesecake (a conceit of David Everitt-Matthias, of Cheltenham’s Champignon Sauvage, it seems)  with peanut ice cream and a knob of peanut butter was truly inspired – one of those rare dishes where the whole really does end up tasting of more than the sum of its parts.

The last time London saw three stars was in 2010 when Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester won the accolade. Before that you have to go back to 2004 when Heston’s Fat Duck got its third star. The Fat Duck, we get. But Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester? As our survey reporters say it’s simply “not in the same league” and how it retains its three-star rating year-after-year is a mystery.

Perhaps the guide editors were feeling a bit nostalgic about Bibendum’s home in Chelsea’s iconic Michelin Building, because the reports we have had this year don’t point towards a two-star performance. Overall it received a 2/5 for food in our survey and many seem to think the more ambitious culinary regime has led to “ridiculous prices”.

Our reporters say, and we agree, that Andrew Wong’s new-school Chinese in Pimlico provides some of “the most exhilarating food in London”. However there are a couple of omissions that (we feel) continue to rankle. Gauthier Soho lost its star in 2012 and its continued absence from the list is baffling and starkly calls into question the judgement of the tyre men. And while we’re on the subject, why was Chelsea’s Medlar stripped of its star? Perhaps most confusing though is why Michelin continues to ignore Bethnal Green’s Typing Room? As one survey reporter says: “How this place doesn’t have a Michelin star is beyond belief!”

Furnished, seemingly, from a car boot sale, its small interior features principally a large bar at which the seats, thanks to an almost total absence of leg room, are fearsomely uncomfortable.

Or a decent chocolate mousse. Or to taste from the short but interesting range of wines, scrawled almost illegibly on a whiteboard. The aim here seems rather like that of Paris’s much-fêted Chateaubriand – to offer simple food of a quality which transcends the setting, to a degree which is perhaps supposed to be ironic.

It helps that the landlords - no doubt with lavish incentives - have attracted a critical mass of restaurants, including an already-popular Japanese (Yakitoria), an airy gastropub (The Union), a soon-to-open fish specialist, and the Chinese restaurant we review today.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/az/restaurants/london/w2/pearl-liang.htm|The food, though, is a redeeming feature. Dim sum are a speciality (served lunch and dinner), and come at a prices reminiscent of Chinatown, and up to the same standards as the best operators there. Larger dishes - such as Peking Duck and steamed sea bass - were also realised to a superior standard. Puddings included an oddly satisfying, blue blancmange-y number. In fact, everything was consistently above par.

Certainly not the latter, as it reminded Ms Dent of her recent meal at Tast in Manchester. Dishes like gnocchi with miso halibut, usuzukuri toro with pan con tomate and “many other raw things flecked with caviar or truffle” are challenging, poorly put together (“the standard of sushi rolling is sleeker at the Sushi Daily stand in Waitrose”) and service is either ” mob-handed” or entirely absent.

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-11-2009/kitchen-w8/|Philip Howard is one of those blameless chefs who beavers away doing what chefs are supposed to do – for younger readers, that’s cooking – year after year. It’s no particular surprise, then, that standards at his grand Mayfair restaurant, the Square, are a model of consistency. His has proved to be a nothing-to-scare-the-horses cuisine that has long made this one of the top destinations for grander business dining.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-11-2009/kitchen-w8/|Part of the problem is that these are premises which just don’t have zing. Though they are in a street long associated with restaurants (and one that leads into one of the most chichi Kensington backwaters), Abingdon Road has always struck us as rather a forlorn thoroughfare, and the recent establishments on this site have never managed to transcend their location.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/13-11-2009/kitchen-w8/|Perhaps, though, the cooking here will make it ‘third time lucky’ for Ms M. It’s certainly of a very high quality (and it’s already driving the foodie end of the Twitterati to heights of ecstasy). On our meal the bread was splendid (we’d suggest the sourdough), and an autumnal soup was as rich and as satisfying as you could hope for, and came – rather unusually – with a mini-kebab or two. We can’t remember precisely what they consisted of, but they certainly added interest! A duck leg from the set lunch menu was precisely cooked, the meat falling from the bone but not at all overcooked. A small but perfectly-formed pear financier (sponge pudding, not a chap who tears up £50 notes) was clearly the work of a master.

His elegantly-plated ox-tongue – surely an oxmoron? – certainly looked like the sort of dish you’d fine in a much fancier sort of joint, and he expressed delight both with it and the rabbit terrine which preceded it. Coffee and chocolates were also excellent. Both the menu and the wine list are extensive and reasonably priced (and the latter offers a good choice by the 25cl carafe).

restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/05-04-2006/cardamom-rooms-ec1/|What remained was a far cry from the quirky culinary experience with which I had hoped to regale you. In fact, remove the Thai ‘angle’, and what’s left is a pretty unremarkable Indian restaurant, of the type which continues to colonise many environs of the City. The cooking – rather at the level you might have expected if the kitchen had been struggling to cope with two great cuisines at once  – seemed undistinguished for a brigade that now only needs concern itself with one. The service was fine, if not especially engaging, but looked as if it might get rather over-stretched as the place filled up.

The absurdly discreet entrance doesn’t look like a restaurant at all: even a nightclub like Annabel’s is less of a shrinking violet than this place is. There is no menu outside – isn’t that illegal anyway? And why, when so many restaurants which don’t need doormen have them nowadays, does this place – which desperately does – not have two? (Hey, one in Spanish dress, one Japanese – at least they’d be noticed.) If you do summon up the courage to go in, the Stygian ground floor lobby feels positively spooky. We were half way across the apparently deserted room when a voice demanded to know our business. Well, to go to the restaurant; the lifts from the lobby go nowhere else.

We’re told that measures are in hand to put right many of the most obvious defects. But is there time? Without the mother of all relaunches, this place is fast beginning to look like the biggest pre-Christmas turkey London has ever seen.

Twizoo has built the same thing, but solely for London restaurants. Our number crunching detects the rate of change of influential mentions on Twitter.

The algorithm notes restaurants that have the highest rate of change and ranks them based on which places’ tweets are the most positive collectively and then it takes the top of those based on how influential the individuals are who tweeted.

(Hey, one in Spanish dress, one Japanese - at least theyd be noticed.) If you do summon up the courage to go in, the Stygian ground floor lobby feels positively spooky. We were half way across the apparently deserted room when a voice demanded to know our business. Well, to go to the restaurant; the lifts from the lobby go nowhere else.

Twizoo has built the same thing, but solely for London restaurants. Our number crunching detects the rate of change of influential mentions on Twitter. For example, ‘Christmas’ is currently trending on Twitter, which means there’s been a spike of mentioning Christmas now compared with the rest of the year.
restaurants|20191207|EN|www.hardens.com|https://www.hardens.com/uk-london/14-05-2015/this-weeks-top-5-trending-restaurants-on-twitter/|Applying this to Twizoo’s algorithms: if X restaurant usually gets on average 10 tweets per week, but this week it gets 32 tweets… that’s a pretty big change, so it’s a good indicator something notable is going on. The algorithm notes restaurants that have the highest rate of change and ranks them based on which places’ tweets are the most positive collectively and then it takes the top of those based on how influential the individuals are who tweeted. Simple see?
