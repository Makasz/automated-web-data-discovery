If you don’t want chilli make a simple herb oil by blending a flavourful herb (like oregano or basil) with some oil, allowing it to infuse and then pass it through a coffee filter or similar and you are good to go.

Hot/Cold chocolate variations with milk sorbet and passionfruit gel Tom inherited the open kitchen from Gillan’s days (still seen here while he gets his new gig going), the restaurant is relatively small, a couple steps from the banquette high tables to his pass, so there is a sense you’re almost in there. He also inherited liquid nitrogen, nice crockery,all part of the genesis, or shall we say the presentation of it, as he summoned us to into the kitchen for pudding …and I thought i’d never see the day Kembler did modernist. Jack is on pastry, turn it up 🔊 , you’ll hear Tom give a quick run down of the dish as Jack prepares it. An homage to @sportsmankent Stephen Harris’ warm chocolate mousse (also iSi whipper) with milk ice cream, & ongoing development with @pumpstreetchocolate (72%Bourbon mousse) , with a very clean milk sorbet from his Bonhams days (made with creme crue, which I love). – Firstly, the pudding is gorgeous in its simplicity – and a very pure milk chocolate. Chaud/froid study of contrasting temperatures, warm mousse to ice cold cream to nitro cold crumble (so to speak). Served in a bowl, the whole thing yields pure satisfaction – the spoon eases in smooth, snappy tuile then mousse(swipe 👉). I mopped it up in seconds. A true pud. I generally avoid a heavy chocolate, but this is notable in that you get the sinful comfort, but come away with a light finish. Secondly, and perhaps more so, the interaction works especially well for this one. Rather than for show, Tom’s used the nitrogen to refry the chocolate, so there is an element of la minute prep that’s integral to the eating experience. As the dining room is so close, its easy for people to pop into the kitchen to see their pud being put together, and it totally works well as a finale to the taster menu. Also, notice Tom casually showing off his perfect rochers, two in a row.🌟..🌟. Hope Stephen tries this one day, I’m pretty sure he’ll be pretty happy with it. I most certainly was. @tfkemble @jack_robey1996 @aaronmcnamara_91 @greground1 @south_lodge #horshamrestaurants #eaterlondon @eaterlondon #lefooding #sushikemble

Then simmered in dashi, sherry vinegar, kaffir lime. Claws and tail poached in the stock and then all the precious juices are saved and all poured back into the soup. Shells are then toasted on a dry pan until it just starts to smoulder. Then it is all chucked into the stock. Topped with water on the odd occasion, only a touch of salt and then simmered for a day. The noble shellfish’s sheer purity of natural sweetness never ceases to amaze me. Finally it is sieved. Touch of paprika, lemon, cream and butter, blitzed with a hand food processor, et voila, bowl of liquid joy.

While it is vogue for today’s European based chefs to borrow (heavily) from the Japanese (dashis, vinegars, seaweed), Jeremy Chan has chosen an altogether different route to peak umami via Jollof cuisine. It might be highly presumptuous of me to offer Jeremy as the modern day version of Olivier Roellinger; classic techniques with a growing knowledge of spices… though quite some way before Chan reaches Roellinger’s legend status.

Leave aside any preconceived notions of what you think the cuisine here is. For me, I think of it as Modern European with Nigerian spices and vegetables, but the terroir is most definitely British, and it makes this very much a London restaurant. The guys have been chipping away at their little project for about 2 years now, and I think Jeremy has now begun shaping something that is both delicious and uniquely his own. Not so easy to stand out in this realm with so much Gastronomic history already cataloged today, but Jeremy and Iré have just about pulled it off.

I love potatoes, in all the various prep, including as raw noodles, and this was something new that I could add to my taste memories. It really was superiorly comforting, the ultimate comfort food feels, leave me in a room with a spoon and couple of bowls of this, I would happily polish it all off and ask for more. To cut the richness, there is a dose of acidity, which I assume is from the mead gel, and a little freshness from citrus zest. Topped with the best cut of chicken, two nuggets from it’s back. To make something so special from humble ingredients. Stunning dish!

The texture was loose, very tender and juicy. In terms of flavour, the coffee imparted a light acidity, and who knew that coffee harmonised so well with beef.

If I am to be honest, personally, the coffee sauce seemed excessive, as a light jus with some more freshness would have sufficed for me, though it didn’t detract from the brilliance of the protein itself. It was seriously a pristinely cooked tenderloin. Beef so often is a boring choice for a taster menu, but not this one. A bold dish!

The meal also featured all other cuts including round, ribeye cap, tail, shank, chuck, ribeye, sirloin, fillet and its prized fat (in an old fashioned no less). Hamada san’s Ozaki (as in Mr Ozaki’s beef to be exact. The only beef in Japan that carries its farmer’s name) and 2017 grandprix Kobe were phenomenal.

I’ve been thoroughly impressed by the young Chef’s progression ever since he started up a few years ago in Stoke Newington.

The craft involved is spot on. There is a huge dose of umami and the comfort factor is high. Inside the cavity, there is a layer of shaved truffle, then lardon melting into the pearl barley, all warm inside and soaking up all of the juices, analogous to say rice with Hainanese chicken (so to speak) – it gives familiar and immeasurable satisfaction.

Given that I was in both countries for this trip, i grabbed the chance to experience both restaurants back to back. Kawate san has entrusted logy’s slick open counter kitchen – mirroring Florilege’s own – to Ryogo Tahara, his former sous for the last 3 years, naming it to signify the blending of Asian culture, grounded in Taiwanese soil.

Like Florilege, Tahara san’s cuisine is modern and unique, yet it is realised mostly through classic technique and showcases his ongoing study of the riches of Taiwanese produce.

It is worth mentioning that Florilege has an excellent option for a soft pairing flight.

Both men are classically trained but shun French products, instead eagerly direct their attention to the locality around them, concerned about food waste (Brett makes compost from his kitchen waste, which punters can take home, which I have on a few occasions for our garden) and both are especially gifted in identifying value in otherwise unloved ingredients or cuts by transforming them into something unexpectedly special.

Meanwhile Kawate san makes a luscious cold shabu-shabu from the loin of cows which have given birth to calves – meat that would never grace the menu of fine Japanese steak houses which -amongst other things- demand virgin cows. There is a lot to admire when a chef is able to raise noble produce to new heights of course, but it takes true genius to make something out of nothing.

As I mentioned earlier, Taiwan is bursting at the seams with quality produce that is only beginning to get the global coverage it deserves. There is much untapped potential yet as I am sure Tahara san will continue to develop as he discovers and codifies more creations using Taiwanese produce. The man is young and enthusiastic and I have no doubt we will hear more of logy’s rising star in the years to come.

Spontaneity and creativity reign supreme, Passard and his kitchen still immensely spirited in their practice of gastronomy at the highest levels, they continue to introduce new dishes to their menu, not bad for a restaurant now in its 33rd year. As usual, Tony Beldroega was in charge of the affairs today, with the Chef himself making an appearance mid-way through lunch to greet punters.

The food here is fine in its eating, while the dishes are beautiful to look at, the kitchen spends the majority cooking rather than plating little things perfectly. Some people do not like it for this very reason, but I love L’Arpege because at the heart of it all, the restaurant is about pure cooking, slow grilled proteins cooked grand and whole, and daring la minute preparations for everything else. It might seem counter intuitive to say this, but in today’s world of foraged, water bath modernism, L’Arpege is in the minority when it comes to actually delivering hot food on piping hot plates.
